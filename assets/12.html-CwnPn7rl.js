However, the native writing system for New Ithkuil is unique to the language and is neither an alphabet, nor syllabary, nor ideographic system of writing, but rather is <strong>morpho-phonemic</strong>, that is, the graphic characters employed to display the written language convey both phonological and morphological (i.e., grammatical) information, by which the reader constructs the intended words being conveyed based upon the reader’s knowledge of the grammar of the language.</p><p>This morpho-phonemic principle can be illustrated by the following simple and crude analogy using Roman characters: suppose the past tense written form of the verb “go” in English were “gø” (pronounced “went”), where the diagonal bar through the vowel-letter conveys a change from present to past tense. This would be an example of a morpho-phonemic script, where the characters convey whatever phonetic information cannot be predicted, but where predictable forms (e.g., an English speaker’s knowledge that the past-tense form of “go” is “went”) are conveyed by a symbol or graphic modification indicating the intended morphological change only (e.g., change the verb to past tense), without any graphic representation of the phonetics of the resulting word itself.</p><p>Consequently, the New Ithkuil writing system provides characters to convey the basic consonants needed to display the unpredictable parts of a word, whether it be a lexemic root, the <code>Cs</code> portion of a <code>VxCs</code> Affix, or a specific Referential category, but otherwise provides only diacritic-like augmentations, patterned mutations of phonetic characters, or specialized glyphs, each conveying morphological (i.e., grammatical) modifications by which the reader uses their knowledge of the grammar to phonetically instantiate the correct word.</p><div class="t">Sequence of Written Characters for Formatives</div>',5),I=e("p",null,"Primary Character",-1),R=e("ul",null,[e("li",null,"Relation"),e("li",null,"Concatenation Status"),e("li",null,"Stem"),e("li",null,"Specification"),e("li",null,"Function"),e("li",null,"Context"),e("li",null,"Version"),e("li",null,[e("code",null,"Ca"),a(": Affiliation, Configuration, Plexity, Perspective, Extension, Essence")])],-1),P=e("p",null,"Secondary Character",-1),j=e("p",null,[e("code",null,"Cr"),a(" Main Root")],-1),D=e("p",null,"Secondary Character(s)",-1),Q=e("p",null,[e("code",null,"Cs"),a(" (Slot V)")],-1),E=e("p",null,"Secondary Character(s) [rotated]",-1),M=e("p",null,[e("code",null,"Cs"),a(" (Slot VII)")],-1),W=e("p",null,"[character is laterally rotated 180 degrees]",-1),B=e("p",null,"Tertiary Character",-1),F=e("ul",null,[e("li",null,"Valence"),e("li",null,"Phase"),e("li",null,"Effect"),e("li",null,"Aspect"),e("li",null,"Level")],-1),N=e("p",null,"Quaternary Character",-1),U=e("p",null,[e("code",null,"Vc"),a(" / "),e("code",null,"Vf"),a(" Or "),e("code",null,"Vk")],-1),q=e("ul",null,[e("li",null,"Mood and/or Case-Scope")],-1),L=n('<p>For a <strong>Concatenated Pair</strong> of formatives, each formative is simply written separately, first the concatenated formative, then the parent formative.
