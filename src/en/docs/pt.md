title: Phonotactic Rules
---

<!-- v. 1.0 -->

In the following discussion, the term “consonant-form” refers to either a single consonant or any contiguous grouping of two to six consonants. The term “vowel-form” refers to either a single vowel, a diphthong, or a disyllabic vowel conjunct (e.g., -**o**-). The term “liquid” refers to the consonants -**l**- and -**r**-, the term “semi-consonant” refers to -**w**- and -**y**-, the term “nasal” refers to -**m**-, -**n**-, and -**ň**-, the term “sibilant” refers to -**s**-, -**z**-, -**š**-, -**ž**-, -**c**-, -**ż**-, -**č**-, -**j**-, and -**ç**-. the term “affricate” or “sibilant affricate” refers to -**c**-, -**ż**-, -**č**-, and -**j**-, and the term “sibilant fricative” refers to -**s**-, -**z**-, -**š**-, and -**ž**-. The term “non-back fricative” means any fricative other than -**x**- or -**h**-. The term “homologous (consonants)” means that two consonant share the same place of articulation (e.g., apico-dental, lamino-velar, etc.) A form preceded by an asterisk means the form is prohibited/unacceptable. Readers should also be aware that these rules are not the same as those of Ithkuil (some combinations are more strictly constrained while others are more permissible).

::: danger Revisor’s Comment

The phonetic manifestations of foreign words and loanwords are not constrained by the phonotactic rules.

All the forms provided below are subject to evaluation. Kindly exercise patience and await the outcome.

:::

## 1. General phonotactic constraints {#Sec1}

1. All syllables must contain a single vowel or a single diphthong. <ins>However, Bias Adjuncts are an exception to this rule, as they are exclusively comprised of consonants and are syllabic in their own right.</ins>
2. Vowels or diphthongs are not permitted in word-initial position; all word-initial syllables must begin with a consonant. For words beginning with a glottal-stop followed by a vowel, the glottal-stop is not written, however it must still be pronounced.
3. Any word-medial or word-final syllable may begin with a consonant-form or may begin with a single vowel only if the preceding syllable ends in a single vowel (not a diphthong). Diphthongs cannot immediately follow a vowel or another diphthong. (This is different from Ithkuil 2011, where forms such as -*eai*- are permitted).
4. Disyllabic vowel conjuncts (e.g., *ae*, *eo*, *ia*, *où*) are permitted, but tri-syllabic vowel-conjuncts or greater are not.
5. The glottal-stop occurs in word-initial position (where it is unwritten) followed by a vowel, as well as in syllable-initial position inter-vocalically (i.e., preceded by and followed by a vowel). It also occurs in syllable-final position if preceded by a vowel and followed by a consonant. It cannot be immediately preceded by another consonant in the same word. The glottal stop cannot occur in word-final position except in the unusual instance of monosyllabic parsing adjuncts of the form ’V’ where V is a single vowel (e.g., **’a’**, **’o’**, **’u’**, etc.)
6. If a word begins with **h**-, the preceding word cannot end with -**h** if it is in the same breath-group. The two words must either be separated by a pause, or a(n epenthetic) vowel must be added to the end of the first word. {#p1_6}
7. Geminated (doubled) consonants are permissible (except for the glottal-stop, -**w**-, and -**y**-), but a contiguous string of the same consonant repeated three or more times in a row is not permitted.

## 2. Prohibited consonantal conjuncts {#Sec2}

Due to difficulty/awkwardness in pronunciation, or because they are too phonetically indistinguishable from other forms, the following general restrictions on consonantal forms apply, whether within the same syllable or across adjacent syllables. (NOTE: See Section 7 below as to when prohibited consonant forms occur at the boundaries of two adjacent words.)

::: warning NOTE

See [Section 7](#Sec7) below as to when prohibited consonant forms occur at the boundaries of two adjacent words.

:::

1. No consonant can be immediately followed by a glottal-stop in the same word.
2. The dental stops (**t**, **d**) cannot be immediately followed by any sibilant (**s**, **z**, **š**, **ž**, **c**, **ż**, **č**, **j**), as these would be homophonic with the various sibilant affricates (**c**, **ż**, **č**, **j**) or their geminated forms (**cc**, **żż**, **čč**, **jj**). Neither can the dental stops be followed by their fricative counterparts, as the stop portion of such a conjunct is too audibly indiscernible; thus, the following conjuncts are not permitted: \*-**tţ**-, \*-**dţ**-, \*-**tḑ**-, \*-**dḑ**-.
3. The velar stops -**k**- and -**g**- cannot be followed by the velar/uvular fricative -**x**- nor by the velar nasal -**ň**-.
4. Although some natural languages such as English allow voiceless-voiced pairings of homologous stops such as /kg/ in _ba**ckg**ammon_ , /td/ as in _le**td**own_, or /pb/ as in _cli**pb**oard_ 中的 /pb/, such combinations are not permitted in this language. The reversed. pattern of voiced-voiceless pairings (e.g., /gk/, /dt/, /bp/) is likewise prohibited. Non-homologous pairings are permitted, e.g., **kd**, **pd**, **gp**, **tg**, **pg**, **dk**.
5. The same restriction on homologous voiced-voiceless (and voiceless-voiced) pairings applies to fricatives and to affricates. Thus conjunctions such as the following are prohibited: \***fv**, \***vf**, \***ţḑ**, \***ḑţ**, \***cż, \*żc**, \***čj**, \***jč**. Note that pairings of non- homologous sibilant affricates are permitted if the first is alveolar and the second alveolo-palatal, e.g., **cč**, **cj**, **żč**, **żj**, but not the reverse, e.g., \***čc**, \***jc**, \***čż**, \***jż**.
6. An alveolo-palatal sibilant fricative followed by an apico-alveolar affricate is not permitted, i.e., \***šc**, \***šż**, \***žc**, \***žż**.
7. The sibilant fricative -**s**- cannot be followed by voiced affricate -**ż**-.
8. Other than geminates, any conjunction of sibilant fricatives (**s**, **z**, **š**, **ž**) is prohibited, e.g., \***sz**, \***žs**, \* **šs**, etc.
9. Conjunction of a sibilant affricate followed by a sibilant fricative is prohibited, e.g., \***čs**, \***cz**, \***żz**, \***čž**, \***żs**, \***js**, \***jz**, \***jš**, etc.
10. The voiceless palatal fricative -**ç**- cannot be preceded or followed by a a sibilant fricative (**s**, **z**, **š**, **ž**), nor preceded by a sibilant affricate (**c**, **ż**, **č**, **j**), nor followed by a voiced sibilant affricate (**ż**, **j**). Additionally, -**ç**- cannot be preceded or followed by -**ļ**- or -**h**-, and cannot be preceded by -**x**-.
11. Conjunction of a nasal with an affricate of the same or similar place of articulation is prohibited, as these are too phonetically indistinguishable from nasals followed by the corresponding sibilant fricative. Thus, the following conjuncts are prohibited: \***nc**, \***nč**, \***nż**, \***nj** in that they are too phonetically similar to **ns**, **nš**, **nz**, **nž**.
12. Similarly to the above, conjuncts of -**m**- followed by a bilabial stop plus a bilabial or interdental fricative or dental stop are prohibited, as they are too phonetically indistinguishable from the same conjunct without the medial stop, e.g., \***mpf**, \***mbv,** \***mpţ**, \***mbḑ¸\*mpt**, \***mbd** (vs. **mf**, **mv**, **mţ**, **mḑ**, **mt**, **md**). The combination \***ngḑ** is likewise prohibited (but not **nkţ**).
13. Again, similarly to the above, conjuncts of a nasal followed by a homologous stop plus sibilant are prohibited, as they are too phonetically indistinguishable from the same conjunct without the medial stop, e.g., \***mps**, \***mbz**, \***nks** [vs. **ňs**], \***ngz** [vs. **ňz**], \***mpš**, \***mbž**, \***nkš** [vs. **ňš**], \***ngž** [vs. **ňž**], etc.
14. The nasal **n**- cannot be followed by the labial stops -**p** and -**b**, as they are too likely to assimilate to -**mp**- and -**mb**-.
15. The combinations **nf**, and **nv** cannot be followed by a consonant; they must be followed by a vowel.
16. The velar nasal -**ň**- cannot occur before velar -**k**-, -**g**-, or uvular -**x**-, since the dental nasal -**n**- already assimilates to velar [ŋ] before these three consonants. (Note that the combination **ňř** is permitted, since -**n**- does not assimilate to velar [ŋ] before -**ř**-.) Additionally, the velar nasal **ň**- cannot be followed by -**y** (as the resulting combination \***ňy** is phonetically too indistinguishable from **ny**).
17. The velar/uvular fricative -**x**- cannot be followed by any sibilant fricative (**s**, **z**, **š**, **ž**), -**ç**-, -**g**-, -**ļ**-, -**ň**-, -**y**-, -**h**- or -**ř**-.
18. The lateral fricative -**ļ**- cannot be preceded by a voiced stop nor by -**h**- or -**ç**-. It cannot be followed by any sibilant fricative nor by -**h**- or -**ç**-.
19. As the final member of a consonant conjunct, -**h**- cannot be preceded by the lateral fricative -**ļ**- nor the velar/uvular fricative -**x**-, nor the palatal fricative -**ç**-.
20. Neither -**r**- nor the fricative -**h**- can be followed by uvular approximant -**ř**-.
21. The uvular approximant -**ř**- cannot be followed by -**r**-.
22. In consonant conjuncts, the semiconsonants -**w**- and -**y**- can only appear as the last member of the conjunct and must be followed by a vowel-form. <ins>Syllables cannot end with **w** or **y**.</ins>
23. The following combinations are considered phonetically awkward and are not permitted: -**ḑs**-, -**ḑš**-, -**ḑz**-, -**ḑž**-, and -**nň**-.
24. Because the consonant forms -**ç**- and -**hl**- (pronounceable as -**ļ**-) figure so prominently in the language in terms of morphology, to avoid any confusion the geminated forms -**çç**- and -**ļļ**- are not permitted. <ins>The exception to this rule is the product of the word-initial prefix ç(ë) plus y-, çç-.</ins>

## 3. Permissible Word-Initial Consonant Forms {#Sec3}

A word-initial consonant-form contains from one to four consonants, #C(C)(C)(C)-, and has the following structural rules (not including rules for geminated forms — see [Sec. 6](#Sec6)):

1. **Monoconsonantal Form #C**-: Any single consonant, including the glottal-stop, is permissible in word-initial position except for **ļ**- (as it is phonetically indistinguishable from the allophonic pronunciation of word-initial **hl**-).
2. **Biconsonantal Form #CC**-: Any stop other than the glottal stop (i.e., **p**, **b**, **t**, **d**, **k**, **g**) may be followed by any liquid or approximant (i.e., **r**, **l**, **ř**, **w**, **y**). The stops **p**, **b**, **k**, and **g** may be followed by a sibilant fricative of the same voicing (e.g., **ps**, **gz**, **kš**, **bž**, etc. but not \***pz**, \***gs**, \***kž**, **bš**, etc.). Stops may be followed by any non-sibilant fricative of the same voicing and a different place of articulation, e.g., **pç**, **pf**, **bv**, **pţ**, **bḑ**, **pļ**, **px**, **tç**, **ph**, **tf**, **dv**, **tx**, **tļ**, **th**, **kç**, **kf**, **gv**, **kţ**, **gḑ**, **kh;** exceptions to this rule are \***kļ** (which is phonetically too indistinguishable in normal speech from **tļ**), as well as any form which would violate the rules in [Sec. 2](#Sec2) above. In word-initial position, bilabial and dental stops cannot be followed by a nasal, e.g., \***pm**, \***bn**, \***pň**, \***tn**, \***dm**, \***tň**, however velar stops may be followed my -**m** or -**n**, e.g., **km**, **gn**, etc. Additional rules for word- initial bi-consonantal conjuncts are as follows:
    1. A word-initial sibilant fricative (**s**, **z**, **š**, **ž**) may be followed by any other consonant of the same voicing, except another sibilant fricative, -**ļ**, or -**h**. Additionally, a sibilant fricative, whether voiced or voiceless, may be followed by any nasal, any liquid, any approximant, or -**v**.
    2. A word-initial sibilant affricate (**c, ż**, **č**, **j**) may be followed by any liquid, any nasal, -**w**-, or any stop consonant of the same voicing. It can also be followed by any non-sibilant fricative of the same voicing other than -**ļ**, and may also be followed by -**v** regardless of voicing. It cannot be followed by a sibilant fricative (**s**, **z**, **š**, **ž**) or another affricate or -**y**.
    3. Word-initial **x**- may be followed by -**p**, -**t**, -**c**, -**č**, -**m**, -**n**, -**l**, -**r**, or -**w**.
    4. Word-initial **ç**- may be followed by -**p**, -**t**, -**c**, -**č**, -**k**, -**m**, -**n**, -**ň**-, -**l**, -**r**, -**ř**-, or -**w**.
    5. Word-initial fricatives **f**, **v**, **ţ,** and **ḑ** may be followed by any liquid, approximant, or nasal. They may also be followed by any stop consonant or affricate of the same voicing.
    6. While -**ļ**- is not permitted as a single word-initial consonant, it is permissible as the initial member of a word-initial consonant conjunct. As such, it can only be followed by a voiceless stop, a voiceless affricate, a nasal, or -**w** or -**y**.
    7. Word-initial **h-** can be followed by liquids -**l** or -**r**, the nasals -**m** or -**n**, or by -**w**.
    8. Word-initial nasals **m-** and **n-** may be followed by a liquid (**l**, **r**) or an approximant (**w**, **y, ř**). The same rules apply to the velar nasal **ň**- except that it cannot be followed by -**y**- or -**ř**.
    9. Word-initial liquids **l-** and **r-** may be followed by the semiconsonants -**w** or -**y**.
3. **Triconsonantal Form #CCC**-: In word-initial tri-consonantal conjuncts, a word-initial stop (other than **t** or **d**) may be followed by a sibilant fricative (**s**, **z**, **š**, **ž**) of the same voicing. The third consonant of such a conjunct may then be any consonant that can follow a sibilant fricative in a bi-consonantal conjunct per the rules above. Word-initial stops (including **t** or **d**) may also be followed by non-sibilant fricatives of the same voicing (excluding -**x**), in which case the third consonant of the conjunct is limited to whichever approximant(s) (-**w** or -**y**) is permitted to follow that fricative in a bi-consonantal conjunct per the rules above. Additional rules for word-initial tri-consonantal conjuncts are as follows: {#p3_3}
    1. Word-initial stops followed by -**l** or -**r**- may be followed by -**w** or -**y**.
    2. Word-initial voiceless stops followed by -**ç** may be followed by -**m** or -**n** or -**ň**.
    3. Bi-consonantal conjuncts beginning with **p**- or **k**- followed by -**f** or -**ţ** may take a following -**y** or -**w**. The forms **pļ**-, and **tļ**- may be followed by -**w or** -**y**.
    4. Word-initial sibilant fricatives (**s**, **z**, **š**, **ž**) as well as **ç**- may be followed by any stop consonant of the same voicing, in which case the third consonant of the conjunct is limited to an approximant or a liquid. Word-initial sibilant fricatives and **ç**- may also be followed by any nasal, in which case the third consonant must be whichever semi-consonant(s) (-**w** or -**y**) is/are permitted to follow that nasal in a bi-consonantal conjunct per the rules above.
    5. Word-initial triconsonantal conjuncts beginning with **h**- are limited to **hlw**, **hrw**, **hmw**, **hnw**, **hmy**, **hny**, and the following forms containing geminates: **hll**, **hrr**, **hmm**, **hnn**.
    6. Word-initial sibilant affricates (**c, ż**, **č**, **j**) followed by a stop consonant of the same voicing may take a following liquid or approximant to form a tri-consonantal conjunct. If the affricate is followed by a nasal, that nasal may be followed by whichever approximant(s) (-**w** or -**y**) is permitted to follow that nasal in a bi-consonantal conjunct per the rules above.
    7. The word-initial consonant conjuncts **fl**- and **ţl**-** may take a following -**w** or -**y** to form **flw**-, **ţlw**-, **fly**- and **ţly**-. Other tri-consonantal conjuncts with initial fricative followed by a liquid consonant must be intervocalic.
    8. Word-initial -**xp** and -**xt** may be followed by -**l**, -**r**, -**w** or **-y**. Word-initial** -**xm**, and -**xn** may be followed by -**w** or -**y**; word-initial **xc** and **xč** may be followed by -**w**.
    9. [For tri-consonantal conjuncts containing geminates, see [Sec. 6](#Sec6) below.]
4. **Tetraconsonantal Form #CCCC**-: Word-initial tetra-consonantal conjuncts are limited to the following:
    1. Word-initial tri-consonantal conjuncts which end in a stop consonant may take a following liquid or approximant to form the fourth consonant, e.g., **pskw**-, **gzdr**-, **kšpl**-, **bždy**-, **pstř**-, etc.
    2. Word-initial tri-consonantal conjuncts consisting of a sibilant + stop + **l** may take a following -**y**, e.g., **skly**-, **zgly**-.
    3. [For tetra-consonantal conjuncts containing geminates, see Sec. 6 below.]

## 4. Permissible Word-Final Consonant Forms {#Sec4}

Word-final consonant forms may be from one to four consonants in length and are structured per the following rules (not including rules for geminated forms — see [Sec. 6](#Sec6)):

1. **-C#**: A single word-final consonant following a vowel-form may be any single consonant except -**w** or -**y**. The glottal-stop can only appear word-finally in the narrow instance of monosyllabic parsing adjuncts of the form ’V’ (e.g., **a’**, **o’**, etc.). (**Note**: As for words ending in -**h**, see [paragraph 1.6](#p1_6).)
2. **-CC#**: Word-final bi-consonantal conjuncts are subject to the following structural rules:
    1. A stop consonant may be followed by any fricative of the same voicing, as long as the rules on prohibited conjuncts from [Sec. 2](#Sec2) are not violated, and with regard for the special rule on final -**h** in [paragraph 1.6](#p1_6). A stop consonant cannot be followed by any affricate, nasal, liquid, or approximant in word-final position.
    2. A labial or velar stop consonant may be followed by a dental stop of the same voicing, e.g., -**kt**, -**pt**, -**bd**, -**gd**.
    3. A sibilant fricative or -**ç**- may be followed by any stop of the same voicing. A sibilant fricative cannot be followed by any other fricative, affricate, nasal, liquid, or approximant in word-final position.
    4. A sibilant affricate or -**ç**- may be followed by a dental or velar stop of the same voicing. A sibilant affricate cannot be followed by any other consonant in word-final position.
    5. The fricatives **f** and **v** may be followed by a dental or velar stop of the same voicing, or by a sibilant fricative of the same voicing. They cannot be followed by any other consonant in word-final position.
    6. The fricatives **ţ**, and **ḑ** may be followed by a dental or velar stop of the same voicing. They cannot be followed by any other consonant in word-final position.
    7. The fricatives **ļ** and **x** may be followed by any voiceless stop. They cannot be followed by any other consonant in word-final position.
    8. The nasals **m** and **n** may be followed by any stop or fricative as long as the rules on prohibited conjuncts from [Sec. 2](#Sec2) above are not violated and with regard for the rule in [paragraph 1.6](#p1_6) . They cannot be followed by any other consonant in word-final position.
    9. The nasal **ň** may be followed by any dental stop or any fricative except **x** or **ļ**. It cannot be followed by any other consonant in word-final position.
    10. The liquid -**r**- may be followed by any consonant except the three not allowed in word-final position ( **’**, **w**, **y**). If followed by **h**, see the rule in [paragraph 1.6](#p1_6).
    11. The liquid -**l**- may be followed by any consonant except **’**, **w**, **y,** **r** or **ň**. If followed by **h**, see the rule in [paragraph 1.6](#p1_6).
    12. Any geminated consonant may appear in word-final position except for a geminated stop.
3. **-CCC#**: The following tri-consonantal combinations are allowed in word-final position: {#p4_3}

| ç | ç | t k |

4. -**CCCC#**: Based on the grammar of the language, the only tetra-consonantal conjuncts which can occur in word-final position are those generated by the Slot VI `Ca` complex. Those that are phonotactically permissible are as follows: {#p4.4}

* [ l/r/ř ] + [ k/p ] + [ s/š/ţ/ç ] + [ t/k ]
* [ l/r/ř ] + [ t ] + [ ç ] + [ t/k ]
* [ l/r/ř ] + [ p ] + [ f ] + [ t/k ]
* [ l/r/ř ] + [ fs/fš ] + [ t/k ]
* [ r ] + [ n/ň/m ] + [ s/š/ţ/ç ] + [ t/k ]
* [ r ] + [ ň/m ] + [ f ] + [ t/k ]

All other `Ca` forms consisting of a tetra-consonantal conjunct cannot be word-final and must be disyllabic and followed by a vowel.

5. Penta-consonantal conjuncts in word-final position: Conjuncts comprising five contiguous consonants are not allowed in word-final position except for those penta-consonantal `Ca` forms that result from gemination of one of the tetra-consonantal `Ca` consonant conjuncts shown immediately above in [Sec. 4.4](#p4.4).

## 5. Permissible Intervocalic Consonant Conjuncts {#Sec5}

Intervocalic consonant forms (i.e., immediately preceded and followed by a vowel-form in the same word) may be from one to six consonants in length and are structured per the following rules (not including rules for geminated forms — see [Sec. 6](#Sec6)):

1. -**C**-: The single voiceless lateral fricative -**ļ**- is not permitted in intervocalic position (to avoid confusion with the allophonically identical -**hl**-). by All other single consonants are permitted inter-vocalically, including the glottal-stop and - **h**-.
2. -**CC**-: Any combination of two consonants that is not prohibited by the rules in [Sec. 2](#Sec2) is permitted inter-vocalically. Additionally, any consonant can occur in inter-vocalic position as a geminate, except for the three consonants that do not geminate ( **’**, **w**, **y**).
3. -**CCC**-: (See the table in [Sec. 9](#Sec9) below.)
4. -**CCCC**-: (See the table in [Sec. 10](#Sec10) below.)
5. -**CCCCC**-: (See the table in [Sec. 11](#Sec11) below.)

## 6. Consonant Conjuncts Containing Geminates {#Sec6}

1. Any single consonant except the glottal stop, -**w**-, and -**y**-, may be geminated in intervocalic position.
2. Any single consonant that may be geminated intervocalically may also be geminated in either word-initial or word-final position except for stops.
3. Tri-consonantal conjuncts containing a geminated consonant as the first two consonants of the conjunct:
    1. In word-initial position, #C₁C₁C₂-: Any permissible word-initial geminate may be followed by any single consonant as long as the non-geminate form of the first consonant plus the third consonant constitute a permissible word-initial bi-consonantal conjunct.
    2. In intervocalic position, -VC₁C₁C₂V-: A geminated consonant may be followed by any single consonant as long as the non-geminate form of the first consonant plus the third consonant constitute a permissible intervocalic bi-consonantal conjunct.
    3. In word-final position, -C₁C₁C₂#: : A geminated consonant may be followed by any word-final single consonant as long as the non-geminate form of the first consonant plus the third consonant constitute a permissible word-final biconsonantal conjunct and the tri-consonantal conjunct as a whole is listed in the table in [Section 4.3](#p4_3).
4. Tri-consonantal conjuncts containing a geminated consonant as the last two consonants of the conjunct:
    1. In word-initial position, #C₁C₂C₂-: A word-initial single consonant may be followed by any geminate as long as the first consonant plus the non-geminate form of the second consonant constitute a permissible word-initial bi-consonantal conjunct and the tri-consonantal conjunct as a whole is listed in the table in [Section 9](#Sec9) below.
    2. In intervocalic position, -VC₁C₂C₂V-: a geminated consonant may be preceded by any single consonant as long as the first consonant plus the non-geminate form of the second consonant constitute a permissible intervocalic bi-consonantal conjunct and the tri-consonantal conjunct as a whole is listed in the table in [Section 9](#Sec9) below.
    3. In word-final position, -C₁C₂C₂#: A word-final geminated consonant may be preceded by any single consonant as long as the first consonant plus the non-geminate form of the second consonant constitute a permissible word-final bi-consonantal conjunct and the tri-consonantal conjunct as a whole is listed in the table in [paragraph 4.3](#p4_3).
5. Tetra-consonantal or penta-consonantal conjuncts containing a geminated consonant:
    Only one geminated consonant pair can occur within a single consonant conjunct. Forms containing two geminated pairs such as \***nnss** or \***rrkll** are impermissible.
    1. Tetra-consonantal conjuncts containing a geminated consonant as the first two consonants of the conjunct:
        1. In word-initial position, #C₁C₁C₂C₃-: A word-initial geminate may be followed by two additional consonants as long as the non-geminate form of the first consonant plus the second and third consonants together constitute a permissible word-initial tri-consonantal conjunct as per [paragraph 3.3](#p3_3) above.
        2. In intervocalic position, -VC₁C₁C₂C₃V-: a geminated consonant may be followed by two additional consonants as long as the non-geminate form of the first consonant plus the second and third consonants constitute a permissible intervocalic tri-consonantal conjunct as listed in the table in [Section 9](#Sec9)below.
        3. In word-final position, -C₁C₁C₂C₃#: See [paragraph 6.5.4](#p6_5_4) below.
    2. Tetra-consonantal conjuncts containing a geminated consonant as the second and third consonants of the conjunct:
        1. In word-initial position, #C₁C₂C₂C₃-: A word-initial single consonant may be followed by any geminate plus a different consonant in fourth position as long as the following two conditions are met: (1) the non-geminated tri- consonantal form of the conjunct is a permissible word-initial tri-consonantal conjunct per the rules in [paragraph 3.3](#p3_3); and (2) the tetra-consonantal conjunct as a whole is listed as a permissible tetra-consonantal conjunct in the table in [Sec. 10](#Sec10) below (e.g., the forms \***krrw**- or \***flly**- would not be permitted).
        2. In intervocalic position, -VC₁C₂C₂C₃V-: a geminated consonant may be preceded by any single consonant and followed by another single consonant as long as the tetra-consonantal conjunct as a whole is listed as a permissible tetra-consonantal conjunct in the table in [Sec. 10](#Sec10) below (e.g., the forms -**krrw**- or -**flly**- would not be permitted)
        3. In word-final position, -C₁C₂C₂C₃#: See [paragraph 6.5.4](#p6_5_4) below.
    3. Tetra-consonantal conjuncts containing a geminated consonant as the third and fourth consonants of the conjunct:
        1. In word-initial position, #C₁C₂C₃C₃-: A word-initial single consonant followed by a different consonant may in turn be followed by any geminate as long as the following two conditions are met: (1) the non-geminated tri- consonantal form of the conjunct is a permissible word-initial tri-consonantal conjunct per the rules [paragraph 3.3](#p3_3)., and (2) the tetra-consonantal conjunct as a whole is listed as a permissible tetra-consonantal conjunct in the table in [Sec. 10](#Sec10) below (e.g., the forms \***ksff**- or \***strr**- would not be permitted).
        2. In intervocalic position, -VC₁C₂C₃C₃V-: A single consonant followed by a different consonant may in turn be followed by any geminate as long as the tetra-consonantal conjunct as a whole is listed as a permissible tetra- consonantal conjunct in the table in [Sec. 10](#Sec10) below (e.g., the forms -**ksff**- or -**strr**- would not be permitted).
        3. In word-final position, -C₁C₂C₃C₃#: See [paragraph 6.5.4](#p6_5_4) below.
    4. Word-final tetra-consonantal conjuncts containing a geminated consonant: {#p6_5_4}
        The only tetra-consonantal conjuncts in word-final position that can contain a geminate consonant are those Slot VI tri-consonantal `Ca` forms that have had one of their consonants geminated per the rules in [Sec. 3.6.1](03#Sec3_6_1) of the Grammar Document. In turn, the tri-consonantal form of the same `Ca` conjunct (i.e., without the geminate consonant) must be permissible as a word-final conjunct per the table in [paragraph 4.3](#p4_3) above.
    5. Penta-consonantal conjuncts containing a geminated consonant:
        Any penta-consonantal conjunct must be permissible per the table in [Sec. 11](#Sec11). Furthermore, a penta-consonantal conjunct can only occur in intervocalic position, it cannot occur in word-initial or word-final position (i.e., it must be preceded and followed by a vowel-form).

## 7. Juncture rules between adjacent words {#Sec7}

1. If any of the prohibited consonant forms described in [Sec. 2](#Sec2) occurs across two adjacent words (i.e., the word-final consonant(s) of one word being juxtaposed to the word-initial consonant(s) of a second word)then the words must be separated either by a pause in speech, by inserting a(n epenthetic) vowel at the end of the first word, or modifying the structure of the second word (e.g., by reformatting the Slot structure of a Simple Formative to utilize the Complex Formative structure).
2. If a word begins or ends with a geminated consonant, the immediately adjacent word cannot end/begin with the same consonant; the triple string of the same consonant must be broken up either by a pause in speech between the two words, by inserting a(n epenthetic) vowel at the end of the first word, or by modifying the structure of the second word (e.g., by reformatting the Slot structure of a Simple Formative to utilize the Complex Formative structure).

## 8. Permissible Bi-Consonantal Conjuncts Which Can Be Roots or Affixes {#Sec8}

Below is a chart showing the 25 permissible mono-consonantal `Cr` roots and the 679 permissible bi-consonantal conjuncts which can be roots. Following that chart is a list of permissible tri-consonantal intervocalic conjuncts which can be roots along with phonotactic rules for these tri-consonantal conjuncts. Finally, there is a listing of the permissible tetra-consonantal intervocalic conjuncts which can be roots in the language.

Permissible and Impermissible Bi-Consonantal Conjuncts That Can Also Be `Cr` Roots and `Cs` Affixes (❌ for impermissible forms)

</table>

Twenty-five of the 27 initial consonants shown in the first column of the above table can be a `Cr` root or `Cs` affix by themselves; note that Nos. 9 and 13, -**ç**- and -**ļ**- by themselves cannot be `Cr` roots or `Cs` affixes but can combine with other consonants to form `Cr` roots and `Cs` affixes (however, their geminate forms -çç- and -ļļ- are not permitted as roots).

Also: No `Cr` root or `Cs` h-, w- or y- affix can begin with **h**-, **w**-, or **y**-; no `Cr` root or `Cs` affix can contain a glottal stop.

::: warning NOTE

In addition to the values in the above table, the following seven forms are permissible as mono-consonantal or bi-consonantal intervocalic forms in the language, but cannot be a `Cr` root form or a `Cs` affix form: -**h**-, -**hl**-, -**hr**-, -**hm**-, -**hn**-, -**hw**-, -**hy**-.**
