Case generally refers to a morphological scheme in which a noun, whether via internal mutation of its phonemes or via affixes, shows what grammatical “role” it plays in the phrase or sentence in which it appears. For example, in the English sentence <q>It was me she saw</q>, the use of the word ‘she’ as opposed to ‘her’ and the use of ‘me’ as opposed to ‘I’ distinguishes the subject of the sentence (the person seeing) from the object of the verb (the one being seen). Similarly, in the German sentence <q>Der Bruder des Knaben sah den Mann</q> (= ‘The boy’s brother saw the man’), the words ‘der’, ‘des’ and ‘den’ distinguish the subject of the sentence ‘brother’ (nominative case) from the possessor ‘boy’ (genitive case) from the object ‘man’ (accusative case).</p><p>The concept of “case” can extend far beyond the notions of subject, object and possessor. Depending on the particular language, there may be noun cases which specify the location or position of a noun, whether a noun accompanies another or derives from another or is the recipient of another. In general, noun cases in those languages which rely upon them often substitute for what in English is accomplished using prepositions or prepositional phrases.</p><p>There are 68 cases in New Ithkuil, each marked on a formative by a vocalic affix in Slot IX. The individual cases are described below in Sections 4.2 through 4.9. However, before doing so, it will be helpful to first discuss the relationship between case and <em>semantic role</em>, as well as the notion of <em>argument structure</em>.</p>',4)),i(d,{data:[{id:"I"},{id:"II"},{id:"III"},{id:"IV"},{id:"V"},{id:"VI"},{id:"VII"},{id:"VIII"},{id:"<mark>IX</mark>"},{id:"X"}],active:8},{title0:n(({value:a,isActive:o})=>e[0]||(e[0]=[s("I")])),title1:n(({value:a,isActive:o})=>e[1]||(e[1]=[s("II")])),title2:n(({value:a,isActive:o})=>e[2]||(e[2]=[s("III")])),title3:n(({value:a,isActive:o})=>e[3]||(e[3]=[s("IV")])),title4:n(({value:a,isActive:o})=>e[4]||(e[4]=[s("V")])),title5:n(({value:a,isActive:o})=>e[5]||(e[5]=[s("VI")])),title6:n(({value:a,isActive:o})=>e[6]||(e[6]=[s("VII")])),title7:n(({value:a,isActive:o})=>e[7]||(e[7]=[s("VIII")])),title8:n(({value:a,isActive:o})=>e[8]||(e[8]=[t("mark",null,"IX",-1)])),title9:n(({value:a,isActive:o})=>e[9]||(e[9]=[s("X")])),tab0:n(({value:a,isActive:o})=>e[10]||(e[10]=[t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Term"),t("dd",null,[s("( "),t("code",null,"Cc")])],-1),t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Category"),t("dd",null,"Concatenation status indicator")],-1),t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Form"),t("dd",null,"consonantal form consisting of either a glottal stop or a form beginning with -h-.")],-1)])),tab1:n(({value:a,isActive:o})=>e[11]||(e[11]=[t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Term"),t("dd",null,[t("code",null,"Vv"),s(" )")])],-1),t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Category"),t("dd",null,"Version + Stem")],-1),t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Form"),t("dd",null,"vocalic affix")],-1)])),tab2:n(({value:a,isActive:o})=>e[12]||(e[12]=[t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Term"),t("dd",null,[t("code",null,"Cr")])],-1),t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Category"),t("dd",null,"Main Root")],-1),t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Form"),t("dd",null,"cons. form")],-1)])),tab3:n(({value:a,isActive:o})=>e[13]||(e[13]=[t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Term"),t("dd",null,[t("code",null,"Vr")])],-1),t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Category"),t("dd",null,"Function + Specification + Context")],-1),t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Form"),t("dd",null,"vocalic affix")],-1)])),tab4:n(({value:a,isActive:o})=>e[14]||(e[14]=[t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Term"),t("dd",null,[s("( "),t("code",null,"CsVx"),s(" ... )")])],-1),t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Category"),t("dd",null,[t("code",null,"VxCs"),s(" affix(es) apply to stem but not to "),t("code",null,"Ca"),s("; Form is -"),t("code",null,"CsVx"),s("- (i.e., reversed from standard Slot VII "),t("code",null,"VxCs"),s(" form)")])],-1),t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Form"),t("dd",null,"consonant + vowel")],-1)])),tab5:n(({value:a,isActive:o})=>e[15]||(e[15]=[t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Term"),t("dd",null,[t("code",null,"Ca")])],-1),t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Category"),t("dd",null,"Configuration + Extension + Affiliation + Perspective + Essence")],-1),t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Form"),t("dd",null,[s("if Slot V is filled, "),t("code",null,"Ca"),s(" is geminated")])],-1)])),tab6:n(({value:a,isActive:o})=>e[16]||(e[16]=[t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Term"),t("dd",null,[s("( "),t("code",null,"VxCs"),s(" ... )")])],-1),t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Category"),t("dd",null,[t("code",null,"VxCs"),s(" affixes apply to stem + "),t("code",null,"Ca")])],-1),t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Form"),t("dd",null,"vowel + consonant")],-1)])),tab7:n(({value:a,isActive:o})=>e[17]||(e[17]=[t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Term"),t("dd",null,[s("( "),t("code",null,"VnCn"),s(" )")])],-1),t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Category"),t("dd",null,[s("Valence "),t("b",null,"OR"),s(" Aspect "),t("b",null,"OR"),s(" Phase "),t("b",null,"OR"),s(" Level "),t("b",null,"OR"),s(" Effect"),t("br"),s(" Choose one of the five + Mood/Case-Scope")])],-1),t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Form"),t("dd",null,"Modular Slot containing a vowel-form + consonant-form")],-1)])),tab8:n(({value:a,isActive:o})=>e[18]||(e[18]=[t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Term"),t("dd",null,[t("code",null,"Vc"),s(" / "),t("code",null,"Vf"),s(" / "),t("code",null,"Vk")])],-1),t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Category"),t("dd",null,[s("Case "),t("b",null,"OR"),s(" Format "),t("b",null,"OR"),s(" Illocution + Validation"),t("br"),s("as determined by Slot X syllabic stress")])],-1),t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Form"),t("dd",null,"vocalic affix")],-1)])),tab9:n(({value:a,isActive:o})=>e[19]||(e[19]=[t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Term"),t("dd",null,[t("code",null,"[STRESS]")])],-1),t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Category"),t("dd",null,[s("penultimate stress = UNFRAMED Relation +"),t("code",null,"Vc"),t("br"),s("ultimate stress = UNFRAMED Relation +"),t("code",null,"Vk"),t("br"),s("antepenultimate stress = FRAMED Relation +"),t("code",null,"Vc")])],-1),t("dl",null,[t("dt",null,"Form"),t("dd",null,"Suprasegmental form")],-1)])),_:1}),e[205]||(e[205]=l('<h2 id="Sec4_1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec4_1"><span>4.1 Semantic Role versus Positional Slot</span></a></h2><p>In most languages, case operates at the surface structure level of language to signify arbitrary grammatical relations such as subject, direct object, indirect object. The deeper level of “semantic role” is ignored in terms of morphological designations. The notion of semantic role can be illustrated by the following set of sentences:</p><div class="indent"><p>(1a)<q>John opened the door with the key.</q><br> (1b)<q>The key opened the door.</q><br> (1c)<q>The wind opened the door.</q><br> (1d)<q>The door opened.</q></p></div><p>In each of these sentences case is assigned based on “slot”, i.e., the position of the nouns relative to the verb, irrespective of their semantic roles. Thus, the “subjects” of the sentences are, respectively, <em>John</em>, <em>the key</em>, <em>the wind</em>, and <em>the door</em>. Yet it can be seen that, semantically speaking, these four sentences are interrelated in a causal way. Specifically, Sentence (1b) results directly from sentence (1a), and sentence (1d) results directly from either (1b) or (1c). We see that the case of the noun ‘key’ in sentence (1a) is prepositional, while in sentence (1b) it is the subject. Yet, the key plays the same semantic role in both sentences: the physical instrument by which the act of opening is accomplished. As for the noun ‘door,’ it is marked as a direct object in the first three sentences and as a subject in the fourth, even though its semantic role in all four sentences never changes, i.e., it is the noun which undergoes a change in its state as a result of the act of opening. The noun ‘John’ in sentence (1a) is marked as a subject, the same case as ‘key’ in (1b), the ‘wind’ in (1c) and the ‘door’ in (1d), yet the semantic role of ‘John’ is entirely different from the role of ‘key’ in (1b) and different again from ‘door’ in (1c), i.e., John is acting as the conscious, deliberate initiator of the act of opening. Finally, the noun ‘wind’ in (1c), while marked as a subject, operates in yet another semantic role distinct from the subjects of the other sentences, i.e., an inanimate, blind force of nature which, while being the underlying cause of the act of opening, can make no conscious or willed choice to initiate such action.</p><h3 id="Sec4_1_1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec4_1_1"><span>4.1.1 Case as Indicator of Semantic Role</span></a></h3><p>The case structures of Western languages mark positional slot (i.e., grammatical relations) only, and have no overt way to indicate semantic role, thus providing no way of showing the intuitive causal relationship between sets of sentences like those above. In New Ithkuil, however, the case of a noun is based on its underlying semantic role, not its syntactic position in the sentence relative to the verb. These semantic roles reflect a more fundamental or primary level of language irrespective of the surface case marking of nouns in other languages. Thus, New Ithkuil noun declension more accurately reflects the underlying semantic function of nouns in sentences.</p><p>The following semantic roles are marked by noun cases in New Ithkuil.

Beginning with Sentence (2a) we see that Mary is an AGENT which tangibly causes injury or pain to the children who obviously function in the role of PATIENT. Thus, (2a) is identical to sentence (1a) in terms of the roles portrayed by the subject and direct object.</p><p>In Sentence (2b) however, <em>Mary entertains the children</em>, there is a subtle distinction. At first, we might consider Mary an agent who initiates a change in the children (i.e., the fact that they become entertained). But, in fact, the act of entertainment is not one whose result (enjoyment by the audience) can be guaranteed by the party doing the entertaining. In fact, the result of the act of entertainment is not Mary’s to determine, but rather the children’s, based on whether they “feel” a sense of enjoyment at experiencing Mary’s act. And so, Mary is more like a patient here, not an agent, as she is undergoing a change in her state or behavior (she is performing an attempt to entertain) which she herself has chosen to initiate and undergo, yet the act has the potential to cause a resulting change in the children, the success of this motivation to be determined by the children, however, not Mary. Such a semantic role as Mary here is termed an ENABLER. And how do the children make the decision as to whether they are entertained or not (i.e., what is their semantic role?). Can the children deliberately or consciously choose to feel a sense of enjoyment, or are they not themselves unwilling “patients” to their own emotional reactions? In case grammar, a party such as the children who undergo an unwilled experience is termed an EXPERIENCER. Besides emotional reactions, such unwilled experiences include autonomic sensory perceptions (e.g., parties that see or hear because their eyes were open and pointed in a particular direction or who were within earshot of a sound), and autonomic bodily reactions or responses as well as proprioceptive sensations (e.g., coughing, sneezing, perspiring, feeling hot or cold, feeling pain, etc.).</p><p>This notion of EXPERIENCER is likewise illustrated by Sentence (2c) <em>Mary sees the children</em>, in which the verb ‘see’ denotes an automatic sensory experience, not a deliberately initiated action. In other words, it is the nature of the sense of sight to function automatically whenever a person is conscious and his/her eyes are open. The verb ‘see’ does not necessarily imply a conscious or deliberately willed action of “seeing” (as would be implied by the verb ‘to look [at]’). Therefore, the “action” is automatic and uninitiated; it is, in fact, not an action at all, but rather an experiential state which the person doing the seeing undergoes. In other words, the person seeing is actually a kind of “patient,” as it is he/she who undergoes the experience of (and physical or emotional reaction to) the particular sight. Such undergoers of sensory verbs and other unwilled states (e.g., emotional states or reactions, autonomic bodily reactions such as sneezing, physical states of sensation such as being hot or cold, etc.) are categorized in the role of EXPERIENCER. And what of the children’s role in sentence (2c)? Unlike the first three sentences, the children do not undergo any action. Certainly the process of “being seen” by Mary does not in itself cause a physical change or reaction of any kind in the entity being seen. Nor can the children be analyzed as “initiating” the act of sight, as they may be completely unaware that Mary is seeing them. As a result, the children’s semantic role is merely that of STIMULUS, a neutral, unwitting originating reason for the experiential state being undergone by the other noun participant.</p><p>In Sentence (2d) <em>Mary tells the children a story</em>, Mary is a patient who initiates the action which she herself undergoes, the telling of a story. The children do not undergo an unwilled emotional, sensory, or bodily reaction here, but rather are the passive and more or less willing RECIPIENT of information, the role of an “indirect object” in Western languages. The story, on the other hand, is merely a non-participatory abstract referent, whose role is termed CONTENT.</p><p>The role of CONTENT also applies to the children in Sentence (2e) <em>Mary wants children</em>, where they function as the “object” of Mary’s desire. Since no tangible action is occurring, nor are the children undergoing any result of change of state, nor need they be even aware of Mary’s desire, they are, like the story in sentence (2d), merely non-participatory referents. As for Mary’s role in (2e), the emotional state of desire, being unwilled, self-activating, and subjectively internal, creates a situation similar to an automatic sensory perception or autonomic body response; thus, Mary’s role is again that of EXPERIENCER.</p><h3 id="Sec4_1_3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec4_1_3"><span>4.1.3 Argument Structure</span></a></h3><p>In addition to case being based on semantic roles, New Ithkuil differs in another important respect from natural languages in that it does not have a default argument structure for its verbal formatives. This is explained below.</p><p>The individual verbs of natural languages each have an implied argument structure, i.e., a pattern of how nouns (i.e., “arguments”) interact with the particular verb and what formal role (from a morpho-semantic perspective) each of those nouns plays in relation to the verb. For example, the verb ‘hit’ in English implies the existence of an agent (i.e., someone doing the hitting) and a patient (i.e., someone undergoing the effect/result of the hitting), as in ‘He hit the dog.’ A different argument structure is illustrated by the verb ‘give’ which implies an agent doing the giving, a patient undergoing the receiving, and a noun functioning in the semantic role of content, i.e., the item being given/received.</p><p>The grammar of natural languages specifies the requirements of which arguments to a verb must be present for a sentence to be grammatical and which arguments are optional. This is illustrated, for example, in the following English sentences (ungrammatical sentences are preceded by an asterisk):</p><div class="indent"><p>(3a)<q>Sam gave the girl a book.</q><br> (3b)<q>Sam gave a book.</q><br> (3c)<q>Sam gave.</q><br> (3d)<q>*Sam gave the girl.</q> (Intended meaning: <q>Sam gave something to the girl</q>)<br> (3e)<q>*Gave the girl a book.</q> (Intended meaning: <q>The girl was given a book</q>)<br> (3f)<q>*Gave the girl.</q> (Intended meaning: <q>The girl was given something</q>)<br> (3g)<q>*Gave a book.</q> (Intended meaning: <q>Someone gave a book</q>)<br> (3h)<q>*Gave.</q> (Intended meaning: <q>Someone did some giving</q> or <q>Giving occurred</q>)</p></div><p>In sentence (3a), all three arguments to the verb ‘gave’ are expressed, while in sentence (3b) the patient/recipient has been deleted. Sentence (3c) deletes both the patient/recipient and the CONTENT argument. In sentence (3d) however, when we try to delete the CONTENT argument of book while preserving the patient/recipient, the sentence requires syntactic restructuring into <em>Sam gave [something] to the girl</em> in order to remain grammatical (the asterisk * in front of the sentence indicates it is ungrammatical). Likewise, sentences (3e), (3f), (3g) and (3h) are ungrammatical when we try to delete the agent, as well as either or both of the other two arguments as well, requiring paraphrasing to make the intended meaning grammatical.</p><p>Compare the above group of sentences containing the verb ‘gave’ with the sentences below featuring the verb ‘broke’:</p><div class="indent"><p>(4a)<q>Tim broke the window with a hammer.</q><br> (4b)<q>Tim broke the window.</q><br> (4c)<q>The hammer broke the window.</q><br> (4d)<q>The window broke.</q><br> (4e)<q>*The hammer broke.</q> (Intended meaning: <q>The hammer broke something</q>)<br> (4f)<q>*Tim broke.</q> (Intended meaning: <q>Tim broke something</q> or <q>Tim did some breaking.</q>)</p></div><p>Notice how sentence (3c) above, <em>Sam gave</em>, is grammatical, but the similarly structured sentence (4f) <em>Tim broke</em> is not. Conversely, notice in comparing sentences (4a) and (4d) that the patient <em>window</em> is grammatical in both object and subject slots, but similarly placing the patient <em>girl</em> from sentence (3a) into subject slot gives the ungrammatical sentence <em>*The girl gave</em> (with intended meaning: <q>The girl was given something</q> or <q>Someone gave the girl something.</q>)</p><p>Other examples of constraints on argument structure in English are illustrated as follows:</p><ul><li><p><q>Bill cut the cake with a knife</q> can be shortened to <q>Bill cut the cake</q>, but the syntactically identical <q>She put the book on the shelf</q> cannot be shortened to <q>*She put the book.</q></p></li><li><p><q>Treatment healed my wounds</q> can delete its agent to give <q>My wounds healed</q>, but the similar <q>Treatment cured my wounds</q> does not allow agent-deletion to <q>*My wounds cured.</q></p></li></ul><p>As can be seen, languages such as English are very haphazard in the various constraints on argument structure applied to individual verbs. Sometimes it is possible to delete arguments but at other times doing so results in an ungrammatical sentence, even though a semantically equivalent paraphrase exists. New Ithkuil has no such constraints on its argument structure. As long as a sentence makes sense semantically and the relationships between explicit or implied arguments and their verb can be determined or inferred, then the New Ithkuil sentence will be grammatically permissible. This is possible because its nouns are marked for semantically-based case, as well as the fact that verbs are marked for Function, a category we discussed in Section 3.8 above.</p>',18)),t("p",null,[e[40]||(e[40]=s("The example sentences above illustrate that the deletion of implied arguments requires a listener/reader to infer the existence of those arguments required for the sentence to make sense semantically.

languages) allows some of its verbs to operate both transitively (i.e., taking a direct object) as well as intransitively (i.e., without a direct object), where the object of the transitive sentence becomes the subject of the intransitive sentence. Furthermore, the intransitive sentence describes the same potential event as the transitive version does, except that no agent is expressed, the focus of the sentence being on the result, not the act which gives rise to the result. Examples:</p><div class="indent"><p><q>The manager opened the store at 8 a.m</q><br> &gt;&gt;<q>The store opened at 8 a.m</q></p><p><q>Robert flies the airplane beautifully</q><br> &gt;&gt;<q>The airplane flies beautifully</q></p><p><q>The engineer increased the pressure</q><br> &gt;&gt;<q>The pressure increased</q></p><p><q>I molded the soft clay easily</q><br> &gt;&gt;<q>The soft clay molded easily</q></p></div><p>Note that the second sentence of each pair above is semantically distinct from its passive voice equivalent (i.e., <q>The store was opened at 8 a.m</q>, <q>The airplane is flown beautifully</q>, <q>The pressure was increased</q>, <q>The soft clay was molded easily</q>in that passives allow for the agent to be overtly stated (using the preposition ‘by’ in English, as in <q>The store was opened by the manager</q>) or, if absent, nevertheless imply the existence of the agent). However, the intransitive sentences above (equivalent to “middle voice” constructions is languages such as Swahili or Turkish) do not allow for expression of an agent and are designed to suppress the semantic relevance (or <em>saliency</em>) of the agent.</p><p>However, English is very haphazard and idiosyncratic as to what verbs it allows to operate this way, often having to resort to paraphrase and idiomatic structures to accomplish the same effects as in the four intransitive sentences above. For example [ungrammatical sentences are preceded by an asterisk]:</p><div class="indent"><q>Father painted the fence yellow</q><br><q>*The fence painted yellow</q><br> (But: <q>The fence came out yellow</q>) <br><br><q>I noticed a storm on the horizon</q><br><q>*A storm noticed on the horizon</q><br> (But: <q>A storm came into view on the horizon</q>) <br><br><q>The owner keeps scissors with the sewing supplies</q><br><q>*Scissors keep with the sewing supplies</q><br> (But: <q>Scissors belong/stay with the sewing supplies</q>) <br><br><q>Fans buy beer a lot at baseball games</q><br><q>*Beer buys a lot at baseball games</q><br> (But: <q>Beer sells a lot at baseball games</q>) </div><p>Of course, many English speakers would simply use the passive voice or a construction using ‘get’ to accomplish the same thing without worrying about the existence of an implied agent. Examples:</p><ul><li><q>The fence was/got painted yellow</q></li><li><q>A storm was noticed on the horizon</q></li><li><q>The scissors are/get kept with the sewing supplies</q></li><li><q>Beer is/gets bought a lot at baseball games</q></li></ul><p>Many languages utilize reflexive constructions to accomplish this effect, e.g., Spanish <q>Se habla español aquí</q>, literally “Spanish speaks itself here,” meaning <em>Spanish is spoken here</em>.</p><p>New Ithkuil, however, can manipulate the assignment of case to verb arguments to achieve this “middle voice” effect for any verb where it is semantically feasible, without having to resort to idiomatic constructions or paraphrase.

Many of the above relationships are addressed by the nine Appositive cases and still others by the nine Associative cases presented in Sec. 4.4.</p><p>The <strong>Appositive</strong> cases make a distinction between alienable versus inalienable possession or attribution, as well as distinguishing whether the possession is inherent to the possessor or imposed or caused from without. These distinctions are explained below. Like Western languages (and unlike many American Indian and North Caucasian languages), the case marking is on the possessor noun, not the possessed. The nine Appositive cases are the <strong>POSSESSIVE</strong>, <strong>PROPRIETIVE</strong>, <strong>GENITIVE</strong>, <strong>ATTRIBUTIVE</strong>, <strong>PRODUCTIVE</strong>, <strong>INTERPRETATIVE</strong>, <strong>ORIGINATIVE</strong>, <strong>INTERDEPENDENT</strong> and <strong>PARTITIVE</strong>.

The POSSESSIVE is used to refer to a noun which has alienable (i.e., removable or severable) possession of another noun in the sense of having physical control or oversight of that noun, whether by chance circumstance or deliberate manipulation. The two nouns are not in any sense inherent parts of one another and the relationship between the two can be theoretically or actually terminated by an outside force or influence, or by decision of the possessor, usually by means of mere physical permanent separation of the possessor and possessed nouns. The Possessive would be used to translate English phrases such as <em><strong>his</strong> coat</em> (e.g., the one he is wearing, regardless of whether he owns it or not), <em><strong>the boy’s</strong> book</em> (e.g., the one in his hand), <em><strong>Father’s</strong> chair</em> (e.g., the one he happens to be sitting in, as in a restaurant).</p><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>kštala</dt><dd>“chair”-[default Ca]-THM</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>wampeicai</dt><dd>[default Ca]-“parent”-GID₂/3-<b>POS</b></dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>father’s chair</q><br>[i.e., the one he’s sitting in]</div></div><h3 id="Sec4_3_2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec4_3_2"><span>4.3.2 <abbr>PRP</abbr> The Proprietive Case</span></a></h3><p>The <strong>PROPRIETIVE</strong> case is marked by the <code>Vc</code> affix -<strong>au</strong> in formative Slot IX.

The two nouns are not in any sense inherent parts of one another, however the relationship cannot be terminated except via an equally or more binding act, declaration, convention, law, process, etc. Using the same English examples used with the POSSESSIVE above, we can analyze the connotative difference: <em><strong>his</strong> coat</em> (i.e., the one he owns, regardless of whether he is wearing it or not), <em><strong>the boy’s</strong> book</em> (e.g., the one he bought), <em><strong>Father’s</strong> chair</em> (e.g., the one quasi-permanently assigned to him).</p><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>onţläla</dt><dd>Stem.0-“automobile”-CTE-[default Ca]-THM</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>wampeicau</dt><dd>[default Ca]-“parent”-GID₂/3-<b>PRP</b></dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>father’s car</q></div></div><h3 id="Sec4_3_3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec4_3_3"><span>4.3.3 <abbr>GEN</abbr> The Genitive Case</span></a></h3><p>The <strong>GENITIVE</strong> case is marked by the <code>Vc</code> affix -<strong>ei</strong> in formative Slot IX.

The ORIGINATIVE identifies a noun as being the literal or figurative source of another, or which is the native location, origin, or usual locational context for another, e.g., <em><strong>the man’s</strong> story</em> (i.e., the one he told), <em><strong>our</strong> gift</em> (i.e., the one we are giving), <em>water <strong>from the river</strong></em>, <em>the fruit <strong>of the tree</strong></em>, <em>Fix the <strong>kitchen</strong> sink!</em> (i.e. the one found in the kitchen), <em><strong>Desert</strong> rocks are so beautiful</em> (i.e., whether being spoken about rocks taken from the desert or rocks still present in the desert), <em><strong>Northern</strong> women are easy-going</em>.</p><p>The ORIGINATIVE should be distinguished from the ABLATIVE in <a href="04#Sec4_8_4">Sec. 4.8.4</a> below, in that the ABLATIVE signifies position or path of motion away from, whereas the ORIGINATIVE merely presents a locational context as a means of description or to distinguish the noun from an otherwise similar noun.</p><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>ekcatra</dt><dd>“fruit”-MSS/G-THM</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>walḑoi</dt><dd>“tree”-<b>OGN</b></dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>the fruits of a tree</q></div></div><h3 id="Sec4_3_8" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec4_3_8"><span>4.3.8 <abbr>IDP</abbr> The Interdependent Case</span></a></h3><p>The <strong>INTERDEPENDENT</strong> case is marked by the <code>Vc</code> affix -<strong>iu</strong> in formative Slot IX. The INTERDEPENDENT identifies a noun which has a coordinated, tandem, complementary or mutually dependent relationship with another. The relationship between the two nouns can be thought of as reciprocal in nature, i.e., each noun implies the other or needs the other to exist within its natural context, e.g., <em>the <strong>students’</strong> teacher</em>, <em>an <strong>army</strong> general</em>, <em>the blood <strong>in my veins</strong></em>, <em>the driver <strong>of the truck</strong></em>, <em>the <strong>nation’s</strong> leader</em>, <em><strong>his</strong> team</em> (i.e., the one on which he’s a member). Note that this case does not imply a part-whole dependency as with the GENITIVE case above, e.g., it would not be used to translate <em>the book’s pages</em>, or <em>the leaves of a tree</em>.</p><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>wailpla</dt><dd>G-“blood”-THM</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>endyaftioriu</dt><dd>“vein”-MDC/PRX-GEN/1m/BEN-<b>IDP</b></dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>the blood in my veins</q></div></div><h3 id="Sec4_3_9" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec4_3_9"><span>4.3.9 <abbr>PAR</abbr> The Partitive Case</span></a></h3><p>The <strong>PARTITIVE</strong> case is marked by the <code>Vc</code> affix -<strong>ui</strong> in formative Slot IX. The PARTITIVE indicates a quantitative or content-to-container relationship between the two nouns, e.g., <em>a cup <strong>of coffee</strong></em>, <em>a box(ful) <strong>of books</strong></em>, <em>a train(load) <strong>of refugees</strong></em>.</p><p>The PARTITIVE is also used to mark a noun qualified by a specific number, e.g., <em>three <strong>boxes</strong></em>, <em>two <strong>clowns</strong></em>, <em>twenty <strong>words</strong></em>. This usage described in <a href="13#Sec13_4">Sec. 13.4</a>, where we will see that, in New Ithkuil, numbers are formatives (i.e., full nouns and verbs), not adjectives as in Western languages. Additionally, a noun qualified by a number is not pluralized. In other words, one does not say ‘three boxes,’ but rather “a trio of a box” or perhaps more eloquently, “a box trio.”</p><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>unţwäla</dt><dd>“bus”-THM</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>kšiţui</dt><dd>“clown”-MDS-<b>PAR</b></dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>a busload of clowns</q></div></div><h2 id="Sec4_4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec4_4"><span>4.4 The Associative Cases</span></a></h2><p>The <strong>Associative</strong> cases refer to a group of nine cases which modify a formative to show that it has and adjectival relationship to another, usually adjacent formative. Most of these cases correspond to relationships in which, in English translation, we find two nouns together in apposition or as a compound noun, as in <q>cat box</q>, <q>schoolbook</q>, <q>peace march</q>, <q>mountain man</q>, etc., or joined by the word ‘of’ in a non-possessive relationship, e.g., <q>dreams of youth</q>, <q>sounds of laughter</q>, or as a modifier of a verbal phrase. The nine Associative cases are the <strong>APPLICATIVE</strong>, <strong>PURPOSIVE</strong>, <strong>TRANSMISSIVE</strong>, <strong>DEFERENTIAL</strong>, <strong>CONTRASTIVE</strong>, <strong>TRANSPOSITIVE</strong>, <strong>COMMUTATIVE</strong>, <strong>COMPARATIVE</strong>, and <strong>CONSIDERATIVE</strong>. Following are explanations of the function and usage of each case.</p><h3 id="Sec4_4_1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec4_4_1"><span>4.4.1 <abbr>APL</abbr> The Applicative Case</span></a></h3><p>The <strong>APPLICATIVE</strong> case is marked by the <code>Vc</code> affix -<strong>ia</strong> (or -<strong>uä</strong> if immediately preceded by -<strong>y</strong>-) in formative Slot IX. The APPLICATIVE identifies a noun which represents the purpose for which another noun is to be utilized in a given instance. As such, it usually translates English ‘for’ when meaning ‘for the temporary or incidental use/purpose of.’ Examples of usage would be <em>a cup <strong>for coffee</strong></em> (i.e., a cup being used incidentally to hold coffee), <em>a box <strong>for tools</strong></em> (i.e., the box is only temporarily being used to hold tools), <em>a room <strong>for changing</strong></em>. Note that the use of the APPLICATIVE can extend to usages beyond English ‘for,’ as in <em>a <strong>“weapon”</strong> cat</em> = ‘a cat used as a weapon,’ or <em>a <strong>“projectile”</strong> book</em> = ‘a book used as a projectile.</p><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>rrala</dt><dd>“cat”-THM</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>udklälia</dt><dd>“projectile.weapon”-CTE-<b>APL</b></dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>a cat for use as a projectile weapon</q></div></div><h3 id="Sec4_4_2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec4_4_2"><span>4.4.2 <abbr>PUR</abbr> The Purposive Case</span></a></h3><p>The <strong>PURPOSIVE</strong> case is marked by the <code>Vc</code> affix -<strong>ie</strong> (or -<strong>uë</strong> if immediately preceded by -<strong>y</strong>-) in formative Slot IX. The PURPOSIVE identifies a noun which characterizes or defines the purpose of, or reason for, another noun. The PURPOSIVE is subtly distinct from the APPLICATIVE above, in that the latter names the actual use to which a noun is put on a given occasion or in given context, whereas the PURPOSIVE defines another noun’s dedicated function or primary reason for being, outside of any contextual instance, i.e., what the noun is used for all the time (or at least its intended use). It generally translates English ‘as,’ ‘of’ or ‘for’ when meaning ‘for the purpose of’ or alternately an English noun-noun expression or a compound noun. Examples of usage would be <em>a <strong>coffee</strong> cup</em>, <em>a <strong>tool</strong>-box</em>, <em>a <strong>litter</strong> box</em>, <em>a <strong>trash</strong>-can</em>.</p><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>skela</dt><dd>“container/receptacle”-CSV-THM</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>agçiţrie</dt><dd>“trash/garbage”-OBJ-MDS/G-<b>PUR</b></dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>a trashcan / a garbage bin</q></div></div><h3 id="Sec4_4_3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec4_4_3"><span>4.4.3 <abbr>TRA</abbr> The Transmissive Case</span></a></h3><p>The <strong>TRANSMISSIVE</strong> case is marked by the <code>Vc</code> affix -<strong>io</strong> (or -<strong>üä</strong> if immediately preceded by -<strong>y</strong>-) in formative Slot IX. The TRANSMISSIVE identifies a noun for whose sake or benefit an action or event occurs or is done or the party to whose detriment an action or event occurs. As such, the TRANSMISSIVE is similar to the DATIVE, except that the TRANSMISSIVE implies a strong emphasis on the fact that the noun is more than simply the recipient or target of a dative action, but rather either benefits or is affected detrimentally in a tangible or consequential way from the action or event. It is usually translated by English ‘for’ in the sense of ‘for the sake (i.e., benefit) of.’ Examples of usage are <em>a toy <strong>for the children</strong></em>, <em>We threw <strong>him</strong> a party</em>, <em>Go to the <strong>teachers’</strong> lounge</em>, <em>I’ll be inspecting the <strong>prisoners’</strong> cells</em>.</p><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>utxala</dt><dd>“drink”-THM</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>welio</dt><dd>“child”-<b>TRA</b></dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>a drink for the child</q></div></div><h3 id="Sec4_4_4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec4_4_4"><span>4.4.4 <abbr>DFR</abbr> The Deferential Case</span></a></h3><p>The <strong>DEFERENTIAL</strong> case is marked by the VC affix -<strong>iö</strong> (or -<strong>üë</strong> if immediately preceded by -<strong>y</strong>-) in formative Slot IX. The DEFERENTIAL translates the English phrases ‘out of respect for,’ ‘for the sake of,’ or ‘in deference toward,’ identifying the noun to which deference is paid within the context for an act, condition, or event. Examples of usage would be <em>He remained silent <strong>for her sake</strong></em>, <em>They went on with the ceremony <strong>out of respect for the families</strong></em>, <em>They dressed in robes <strong>because of tradition</strong></em>.</p><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>ujtajiö</dt><dd>tradition-A-<b>DFR</b></dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>out of respect for tradition</q></div></div><h3 id="Sec4_4_5" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec4_4_5"><span>4.4.5 <abbr>CRS</abbr> The Contrastive Case</span></a></h3><p>The <strong>CONTRASTIVE</strong> case is marked by the <code>Vc</code> affix -<strong>eë</strong> in formative Slot IX. The CONTRASTIVE identifies a noun which has been replaced by another or for which another noun has been substituted. This is translatable by the English phrases ‘instead of’ or ‘rather than’ or ‘as opposed to,’ or specialized uses of ‘not,’ e.g., <em><strong>Instead of rain</strong>, it snowed</em>; <em>They hired her as a cook, <strong>as opposed to a maid</strong></em>; <em>I prefer peas <strong>to carrots</strong></em>; <em><strong>Rather than marigolds</strong>, let’s buy carnations</em>; <em>That’s sugar, <strong>not salt</strong></em>.</p><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>Wat</dt><dd>[default Ca]-“be.what.is.under.discussion”-PRX-(OBS)</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>alcmar</dt><dd>“sugar”-G-(THM)</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>afdareë.</dt><dd>“salt”-G-<b>CRS</b></dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>It’s sugar, not salt.</q></div></div><h3 id="Sec4_4_6" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec4_4_6"><span>4.4.6 <abbr>TSP</abbr> The Transpositive Case</span></a></h3><p>The <strong>TRANSPOSITIVE</strong> case is marked by the <code>Vc</code> affix -<strong>uö</strong> (or -<strong>öë</strong> if immediately preceded by -<strong>w</strong>-) in formative Slot IX. The TRANSPOSITIVE implies substitution of one noun for another. It translates English ‘for’ in the sense of ‘on behalf of,’ ‘in place of,’ or ‘instead of’ (i.e., ‘as a substitution for’). Examples of usage are <em>The boss made the speech <strong>for me</strong></em>, <em>She went up into the attic <strong>for her brother</strong></em> (i.e., so he wouldn’t have to).</p><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>Xpulá</dt><dd>“act.of.substitution”-DYN-OBS</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>kšilo</dt><dd>“clown”-ERG</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>waigvbre</dt><dd>G-“methane”-ABS</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>waiňnuö.</dt><dd>“oxygen”-G-<b>TSP</b></dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>The clown is substituting methane for oxygen.</q></div></div><div class="hint-container warning"><p class="hint-container-title">Revisor’s Comment</p><ul><li>xpulá <em>x</em>-ERG <em>y</em>-ABS <em>z</em>-TSP</li></ul><p><em>x</em> replaces <em>y</em> for <em>z</em> = <em>x</em> replaces <em>z</em> with <em>y</em></p><ul><li>xpulá <em>x</em>-ERG <em>y</em>-ABS</li></ul><p><em>x</em> replaces <em>y</em> for something = <em>x</em> replaces something with <em>y</em></p><ul><li>xpulá <em>x</em>-ABS <em>y</em>-TSP</li></ul><p><em>x</em> is replaced with <em>y</em></p><ul><li>xpulá <em>x</em>-ERG <em>y</em>-TSP</li></ul><p><em>x</em> replaces something for something on behalf of <em>y</em></p><p>Here <em>y</em>’s TSP case associates only with the immediately preceding <em>x</em></p><ul><li>xpulá <em>x</em>-ERG [mi+N]​-ABS <em>y</em>-TSP</li></ul><p><em>x</em> replaces something for <em>y</em></p><ul><li>xpulá <em>x</em>-IND <em>y</em>-TSP</li></ul><p><em>x</em> takes place of <em>y</em>.</p><ul><li>xpulá <em>x</em>-ERG+TSP <em>y</em>-ABS</li></ul><p><em>x</em> gives place to <em>y</em></p><p>Here <em>x</em>’s TSP case associates only with the immediately following <em>y</em></p></div><h3 id="Sec4_4_7" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec4_4_7"><span>4.4.7 <abbr>CMM</abbr> The Commutative Case</span></a></h3><p>The <strong>COMMUTATIVE</strong> case is marked by the <code>Vc</code> affix -<strong>uo</strong> (or -<strong>öä</strong> if immediately preceded by -<strong>w</strong>-) in formative Slot IX.

The COMPARATIVE identifies a noun being compared to another. It translates such expressions as ‘as compared to,’ or certain usages of ‘versus’ or ‘as opposed to.’ It is similar to the CONTRASTIVE case (see Section 4.4.5 above), except that it does not carry the sense of opposition, joint exclusivity, or either-or binary substitution of the CONTRASTIVE, but rather merely comparison/choice/preference from various options or along a spectrum or scale. With verbal Case-Frames (see <a href="06#Sec6_2">Sec. 6.2</a>) it would translate as ‘whereas’ or ‘while’ (in its synonymous usage to ‘whereas’). Examples are <em>She chose the red one <strong>as opposed to the others</strong></em>, <em>Sam drives a van <strong>versus Joe</strong>, who prefers a truck</em>.</p><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>Amsävá</dt><dd>“taste.sweet”-CTE-N-OBS</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>wialcma</dt><dd>N-“sugar”-THM</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>afdavue.</dt><dd>“salt”-N-<b>CMP</b></dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>Sugar is sweet compared to salt.</q></div></div><p>Note that the COMPARATIVE case is also used with the morphological category of Level, discussed in <a href="05#Sec5_5">Sec. 5.5.</a>.</p><h3 id="Sec4_4_9" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec4_4_9"><span>4.4.9 <abbr>CSD</abbr> The Considerative Case</span></a></h3><p>The <strong>CONSIDERATIVE</strong> case is marked by the <code>Vc</code> affix -<strong>ua</strong> (or -<strong>iä</strong> if immediately preceded by -<strong>w</strong>-) in formative Slot IX. It translates English terms such as ‘according to,’ ‘in the opinion of.’ Examples of usage would be <em><strong>In my opinion</strong> he’s a coward</em>; <em><strong>According to our teacher</strong>, humans are descended from apes</em>.</p><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>eddyilua</dt><dd>Stem.2-“teach”-OBJ-[default Ca]-<b>CSD</b></dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>according to the teacher</q></div></div><h2 id="_4-5-adverbial-cases" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-5-adverbial-cases"><span>4.5 Adverbial Cases</span></a></h2><p>Similar the Associative cases above, the <strong>Adverbial</strong> cases are a group of nine cases which modify a formative to show it has an adverbial relationship to another, usually adjacent formative. The nine Adverbial cases are the <strong>FUNCTIVE</strong>, <strong>TRANSFORMATIVE</strong>, <strong>CLASSIFICATIVE</strong>, <strong>RESULTATIVE</strong>, <strong>CONSUMPTIVE</strong>, <strong>CONCESSIVE</strong>, <strong>AVERSIVE</strong>, <strong>CONVERSIVE</strong>, and <strong>SITUATIVE</strong>.</p><h3 id="Sec4_5_1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec4_5_1"><span>4.5.1 <abbr>FUN</abbr> The Functive Case</span></a></h3><p>The <strong>FUNCTIVE</strong> case is marked by the <code>Vc</code> affix -<strong>ao</strong> in formative Slot IX. It functions similarly to English adverbs ending in -ly or the adverbial use of with, identifying the manner in which an action, event, or state occurs or exists. More exactly, it identifies a noun used to characterize the manner of the act, state, or event, translatable most accurately by the phrase ‘in a manner characterized by….’ Examples would be: <em>She dances <strong>gracefully</strong></em> (i.e., in a manner characterized by grace), <em>The boys ate <strong>with gusto</strong></em>, <em>That clown is speaking <strong>nonsense</strong></em>, <em>Father speaks <strong>with such fortitude</strong></em>.</p><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>Wamá</dt><dd>“speak”-OBS</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>kšilu</dt><dd>“clown”-OBJ-IND</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>wiamfmavügao.</dt><dd>“act.of.assurance”-N-EXN₁/8-<b>FUN</b></dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>The clown speaks most assuredly.</q></div></div><h3 id="Sec4_5_2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec4_5_2"><span>4.5.2 <abbr>TFM</abbr> The Transformative Case</span></a></h3><p>The <strong>TRANSFORMATIVE</strong> case is marked by the <code>Vc</code> affix -<strong>aö</strong> in formative Slot IX. The TRANSFORMATIVE identifies the outcome or final state of a process, often translatable by ‘to,’ ‘until,’ or ‘into’ in the sense of reaching a final state after having undergone some transformation. Example usages would be <em>The house burned <strong>to ashes</strong></em>, <em>The clown reached <strong>a state of tranquility</strong></em>, <em>The clowns will turn our children <strong>into slaves</strong></em>, <em>Her father drank himself <strong>to death</strong></em>.</p><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>Weščayá</dt><dd>“pay.money”-RTR-OBS</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>ampasu</dt><dd>“parent”-DPX-IND</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>hakšilaölwie-addyëubzattuo</dt><dd>CONCATENATED:“clown”-<b>TFM</b>-PUR-Parent:“teacher/student.complementary.interaction”-FEA₂/5-MSS-TSP</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>welio.</dt><dd>“child”-TRA</dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>The parents paid for the child’s clown lessons.</q><br>[LITERALLY: ‘the parents paid for lessons-for-becoming-a-clown for the child’]</div></div><h3 id="Sec4_5_3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec4_5_3"><span>4.5.3 <abbr>CLA</abbr> The Classificative Case</span></a></h3><p>The <strong>CLASSIFICATIVE</strong> case is marked by the <code>Vc</code> affix -<strong>eo</strong>. The CLASSIFICATIVE identifies a noun as a basis for arranging, sorting, classifying, or counting, translating various English prepositions and phrases used for this purpose. Example of usage are <em>Place them <strong>in groups of three</strong></em>, <em>The workers arranged the tables <strong>in rows</strong></em>, <em>He lay down <strong>lengthwise</strong></em>, <em>Can you count <strong>by fives</strong>?</em>, <em>I will sort them <strong>by color</strong></em>.</p><p>The CLASSIFICATIVE is also used to identify a noun considered in consecutively recurring increments as a means of describing the manner of an event. Examples: <em>The fertilizer factory keeps rolling them out, <strong>bag upon bag</strong></em>; <em><strong>Patient by patient</strong>, the nurse administered injections</em>; <em><strong>One bomb after another</strong> fell on the city</em>. When used with time periods, however, it is more usual to utilize the SELECTIVE case (see <a href="04#Sec4_7_5">Sec. 4.7.5</a>), however CLASSIFICATIVE can be used instead to emphasize the repetitive nature of an event. Examples would be <em><strong>Month by month</strong>, their departure crept closer</em>; <em><strong>Year after year</strong>, I see more and more clowns</em>; <em><strong>Day in, day out</strong>, he’s always working</em>.</p><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>wajneo</dt><dd>“length.of.object”-<b>CLA</b></dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>lengthwise</q></div><dl class="gloss"><dt>Erčuläyá</dt><dd>“corrupt”-DYN-PRS-OBS</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>kšivo</dt><dd>“clown”-N-ERG</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>weleo.</dt><dd>“child”-<b>CLA</b></dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>The clowns will corrupt child after child.</q></div></div><h3 id="Sec4_5_4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec4_5_4"><span>4.5.4 <abbr>RSL</abbr> The Resultative Case</span></a></h3><p>The <strong>RESULTATIVE</strong> case is marked by the <code>Vc</code> affix -<strong>eö</strong>. The RESULTATIVE identifies a result or consequence, usually translatable utilizing a clause-like structure in English. Examples: <em>He smoked since his teenage years, <strong>hence his early death</strong></em>; <em>The girl has studied for years, <strong>making her an expert</strong></em>, <em>Clowns have secretly infiltrated our schools, <strong>the consequence being our corrupt children</strong></em>; <em>The team made several errors during the game, <strong>resulting in a loss</strong></em>.</p><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>wadpweö</dt><dd>“act.of.blackmail”-<b>RSL</b></dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>resulting in (an act of) blackmail</q></div></div><h3 id="Sec4_5_5" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec4_5_5"><span>4.5.5 <abbr>CSM</abbr> The Consumptive Case</span></a></h3><p>The <strong>CONSUMPTIVE</strong> case is marked by the <code>Vc</code> affix -<strong>oë</strong>. The CONSUMPTIVE identifies the resource consumed or used (up) as a result of, or as a concurrent part of a process. Examples: <em>She cooks <strong>with tomatoes</strong></em>, <em>The clown fed her <strong>an apple</strong></em>, <em>He reads <strong>by candle(light)</strong></em>.</p><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>Elkswuvá</dt><dd>“cook.seafood”-DYN-N-OBS</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>wampacu</dt><dd>“parent”-GID₁/1-IND</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>aţmwaroë.</dt><dd>G-“wine”-<b>CSM</b></dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>Mother cooks seafood with wine.</q></div></div><h3 id="Sec4_5_6" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec4_5_6"><span>4.5.6 <abbr>CON</abbr> The Concessive Case</span></a></h3><p>The <strong>CONCESSIVE</strong> case is marked by the <code>Vc</code> affix -<strong>öe</strong>. The CONCESSIVE case identifies a noun, situation, or circumstance which gives rise to an expectation of a certain result which, in fact, does not occur. This can be translated by various English prepositions, conjunctions, or phrases such as ‘despite,’ ‘in spite of,’ ‘notwithstanding,’ ‘although,’ ‘regardless of,’ ‘no matter what,’ etc. Examples of usage: <em><strong>In spite of his stupidity</strong>, he passed the test</em>; <em><strong>The law notwithstanding</strong>, I will stand my ground</em>; <em><strong>No matter how ignorant (they may be)</strong>, they are welcome</em>, <em><strong>Although foreigners</strong>, we will let them attend the meeting</em>.</p><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>wardplitöe</dt><dd>“act.of.embezzlement”-DCD₁/4-<b>CON</b></dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>in spite of that (act of) embezzlement</q></div></div><h3 id="Sec4_5_7" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec4_5_7"><span>4.5.7 <abbr>AVR</abbr> The Aversive Case</span></a></h3><p>The <strong>AVERSIVE</strong> case is marked by the <code>Vc</code> affix -<strong>oe</strong>. The AVERSIVE identifies a noun as a source or object of fear and/or avoidance. With nouns, it translates expressions such as ‘for fear of,’ ‘in order to avoid,’ or ‘in avoidance of.’ With verb phrases (i.e., Case-Frames; see <a href="06#Sec6_2">Sec. 6.2</a>), it would translate English ‘lest.’ Examples of usage are <em>She finished her plate <strong>for fear of my wrath</strong></em>, <em>I traveled by night <strong>to avoid the sun</strong></em>.</p><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>Wiamftrá</dt><dd>N-“engage.in.drinking.contest”-OBS</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>ru</dt><dd>1m/DET-IND</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>avtyävairxoe.</dt><dd>“state.of.chemical.intoxication”-N-SIM₂/1-<b>AVR</b></dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>I engage in drinking contests out of fear of sobriety.</q></div></div><h3 id="Sec4_5_8" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec4_5_8"><span>4.5.8 <abbr>CVS</abbr> The Conversive Case</span></a></h3><p>The <strong>CONVERSIVE</strong> case is marked by the <code>Vc</code> affix -<strong>öa</strong>. The CONVERSIVE is used in conjunction with hypothetical or potential contexts to identify a hypothetical exception to a potential outcome or an actual circumstance which alters or has altered a potential outcome. This translates two different ways into English. Where it indicates an exception to a hypothetical situation, it is translated by the conjunction ‘unless’ in verbal contexts, and by the preposition ‘without’ for nouns. If applied to a real or actual situation, it is translatable by such expressions as ‘except for’, ‘but for,’ ‘if not for,’ ‘if it wasn’t for,’ or ‘if it wasn’t on account of.’ Example of usage: <em>She loves everybody <strong>except clowns</strong></em>; <em><strong>Without peace</strong>, this society is doomed</em>; <em><strong>If not for the rain</strong>, we would have had a good time</em>; <em>All animals are vermin <strong>except cats</strong></em>; <em>He’ll eat anything <strong>but (not) spinach</strong></em>.</p><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>Wašḑayá</dt><dd>“remove”-RTR-OBS</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>cwe</dt><dd>Mx/NEU/A-ABS</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>warr<ins>ahň</ins>öa.</dt><dd>“cat”-<ins>CCV-</ins><b>CVS</b></dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>Everything was removed except the cat.</q></div></div><div class="hint-container caution"><p class="hint-container-title">Revisor’s Comment</p><p>Note that the Conversive case is an Adverbial case so it will be assumed to convey CCN status when unmarked with Case-Scope.</p></div><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>Wašḑayá</dt><dd>“remove”-RTR-OBS</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>cwe</dt><dd>Mx/NEU/A-ABS</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>warröa.</dt><dd>“cat”-<b>CVS</b></dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>Everything was removed, if it (the removal) wasn’t on account of (the existence of) the cat.</q> / <q>Everything was removed with due allowance for (the existence of) the cat.</q><br>(i.e. the cat is an exception to the romoval)</div></div><h3 id="Sec4_5_9" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec4_5_9"><span>4.5.9 <abbr>SIT</abbr> The Situative Case</span></a></h3><p>The <strong>SITUATIVE</strong> case is marked by the <code>Vc</code> affix -<strong>oa</strong>.

However, these affixes are word-final and it is not phonotactically permissible to end a word with a glottal stop (except the Parsing Adjunct—see <a href="02#Sec2_7_5">Sec. 2.7, No. 5</a>). Therefore, each of these affixes must be modified per the rules in <a href="02#Sec2_2">Sec. 2.2</a>, so that the forms become <strong>a’a</strong>, <strong>ä’ä</strong>, <strong>e’e</strong>, <strong>i’i</strong>, <strong>ë’i</strong>, <strong>ö’ö</strong>, <strong>o’o</strong>, and <strong>u’u</strong>. In addition to the Relational Cases, such modifications per Sec. 2.2 apply to the remaining Affinitive, Spatio-Temporal I and Spatio-Temporal II cases as well.</p><p>Furthermore, to shorten the <code>Vc</code> affix for cases 37 through 52, this glottal-stop may instead be added to any other vocalic form in the formative after Slot II (i.e., it may be added to <code>Vr</code> in Slot IV, to <code>Vx</code> in Slots V or VII, or to <code>Vn</code> in Slot VIII) as long as the formative does not have a Slot IV/VI a + <code>Ca</code> shortcut per <a href="03#Sec3_10">Sec. 3.10</a>, and as long as the <a href="05#Sec5_8">Sec. 5.8</a> rule on moving the <code>Cn</code> Mood/Case-Scope affix to Slot VI has not been applied.</p></div><p>The eight Relational cases are the <strong>PERTINENTIAL</strong>, <strong>DESCRIPTIVE</strong>, <strong>CORRELATIVE</strong>, <strong>RESULTATIVE</strong>, <strong>COMPOSITIVE</strong>, <strong>COMITATIVE</strong>, <strong>UTILITATIVE</strong>, <strong>PREDICATIVE</strong>, and <strong>RELATIVE</strong>.</p><h3 id="Sec4_6_1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec4_6_1"><span>4.6.1 <abbr>PRN</abbr> The Pertinential Case</span></a></h3><p>The <strong>PERTINENTIAL</strong> case is marked by the <code>Vc</code> affix -<strong>a’</strong> (realized as -<strong>a’a</strong>) in formative Slot IX.

It identifies the location where something is situated or occurs; ‘at / in / on / by’. Examples: <em>The children are <strong>in/at the clown’s tent</strong></em>; <em>Hortense is <strong>by the guillotine</strong></em>; <em>Place the four glowing nodules <strong>on the floor</strong></em>; <em>My uncle is <strong>on that plane</strong></em>.</p><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>epřeliʼa!</dt><dd>“entryway”-CSV-<b>LOC</b></dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>at the entrance</q></div></div><h3 id="Sec4_8_2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec4_8_2"><span>4.8.2 <abbr>ATD</abbr> The Attendant Case</span></a></h3><p>The <strong>ATTENDANT</strong> case is marked by the <code>Vc</code> affix -<strong>ie’</strong> (realized as -<strong>i’e</strong>) in formative Slot IX. It functions as a variant of the LOCATIVE case, to indicate in whose presence something occurs/takes place/is situated. However, such a function has implications allowing the ATTENDANT case to identify a vague or externally determined non-causal (and potentially causal) relationship to the event/state/act/occurrence/situation in question. The party marked by ATTENDANT case becomes relevant to or involved in a situation, however, the manner of this involvement/relevancy is vague, undefined, or left to the imagination/speculation of the addressee.</p><p>The rationale behind such an interpretation of the ATTENDANT case is that the party in whose presence something occurs, if animate, implicitly becomes a witness to the occurrence. Being a witness furthermore implies that the party experiences some effect or consequence of what has taken place in their presence. Such an effect/consequence may be nothing more than maintaining a visual memory of what has occurred, but on the other hand, may result in initiating a responsive action by the witnessing party (i.e., a consequent causal act). Even inanimate entities marked for ATTENDANT case can potentially become involved in the state/act/event/situation to the point of causal consequences. For example, if a fire takes place “in the presence of” a box of fireworks, the implied consequence is obvious.</p><p>The following examples illustrate how the ATTENDANT is used to imply contexts of involvement and consequence:</p><div class="indent"><div>[with second party in DATIVE case:]</div><dl class="gloss"><dt>Muliuţmá</dt></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>mu</dt></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>hlü</dt></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>Jon</dt></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>hma</dt></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>ažxíp.</dt></dl><div class="glend"><q>She shouts<q>fire!</q>to John</q></div><div>[with second party in ATTENDANT case:]</div><dl class="gloss"><dt>Muliuţmá</dt></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>mu</dt></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>hliʼe</dt></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>Jon</dt></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>hma</dt></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>ažxíp.</dt></dl><div class="glend"><q>She shouts<q>fire!</q>in John’s presence</q> / <q>She shouts<q>fire!</q>with John nearby</q><br>(thus causing John to do something, e.g., run for a fire extinguisher, run out of the building, etc.)</div></div><div class="indent"><div>[with second party in COMITATIVE case:]</div><dl class="gloss"><dt>Wanzvihá</dt></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>mu</dt></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>welëʼi.</dt></dl><div class="glend"><q>She is playing a game with the child.</q></div><div>[with second party in ATTENDANT case:]</div><dl class="gloss"><dt>Wanzvihá</dt></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>mu</dt></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>weliʼe.</dt></dl><div class="glend"><q>She is playing a game [with someone] while the child watches/while the child sits nearby/in the child’s presence.</q></div></div><p>Also, for sentences where the semantic role of the external head of a relative clause is left unstated (as in the first sentence below), the implied case would be ATTENDANT.

This is useful when there is a string of cases modifying another “base” formative; <code>Cn</code> specifies which has scope over which other formative.</p><p>Note that the <code>Cn</code> affix in Slot VIII is the same affix that shows Mood in verbal formatives (i.e., verbs), described in <a href="05#Sec5_2">Sec. 5.2</a>. The determination as to whether a formative is a noun or verb can be made by its syllabic stress pattern. In contrast to verbal formatives which are stressed on the final syllable of the word, nominal formatives are stressed on the penultimate (i.e., second-to-last) syllable, and framed verbal formatives are stressed on the antepenultimate (third-to last) syllable. Only the latter two show Case-Scope in slot VIII.

This is necessary to accurately translate sentences like the following:</p><div class="indent"><div class="glend"><q>I jog every day except during (an) illness.</q></div></div><p>Examining the above sentence, the phrase “except (for) X” is expressed by the CONVERSIVE case (see <a href="04#Sec4_5_8">Sec. 4.5.8</a>), while the idea of “during X” by the CONCURSIVE case (<a href="04#Sec4_9_1">Sec. 4.9.1</a>). This requires that two different cases to the formative translating ‘illness’, unless we instead resort to expressing the sentence paraphrastically as <q>I jog every day except that I don’t jog during illness.</q></p><p>To allow for two (or more) cases to be assigned to the same formative (or Case-Frame), the base case of the formative is shown as usual by <code>Vc</code> in Slot IX, while the case to be “stacked” upon the base case is expressed by a Case-Stacking affix. Like Case-Accessor affixes, Case-Stacking affixes are structured the same as standard <code>VxCs</code> affixes in formative Slots V and VII. Their phonological structure and full list of the affixes with examples is presented in <a href="07#Sec7_6_4">Sec. 7.6.4</a> at the end of the chapter on <code>VxCs</code> affixes.</p><div class="hint-container caution"><p class="hint-container-title">Revisor’s Comment</p><p>Be careful to distinguish the following situations:</p><p>Please exercise caution when discerning the following applications:</p><ol><li>The utilization of one case to govern another case, as elucidated earlier.</li><li>A straightforward coordinating relationship between multiple cases can be enhanced by employing Type-3 affixes, such as <abbr>COO</abbr> and <abbr>XOR</abbr>.</li></ol><p>If your intention is to derive a formative for the semantic relationship of the case itself, you may refer to the first application as a guide (e.g., any Case Stacking Affix + the Slot IX <code>Vc</code> value representing <abbr>THM</abbr>).</p><p>Please note that the utilization of another stacked case of Referential differs from that of Case Stacking Affix.
