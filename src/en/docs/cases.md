Differences From Ithkuil 2011:

* DESCRIPTIVE <abbr>DSC</abbr> case = adjectival case: “X-ish; like X; having the quality/characteristics of X”
* The use of the CORRELATIVE “characterized by X” moved to <abbr>DSC</abbr> case; “spatially relative to” moved to <abbr>IRL</abbr> case; Conductive <abbr>CNV</abbr> merged into <abbr>COR</abbr>.
* The use of the COMPOSITIVE, when used with verbs (e.g., *She cooks __using tomatoes__*), is eliminated. Instead, this usage can be accomplished via either the INSTRUMENTAL, the UTILITATIVE, or the CONSUMPTIVE depending on the context.
* RELATIVE <abbr>RLT</abbr> case: “...which/that X”, “...which/that is/does X” [creates the equivalent to a simple relative clause]

Eliminated cases:

* POSTULATIVE <abbr>PTL</abbr> merged into Provisional <abbr>PVS</abbr>;
* ABESSIVE <abbr>ABE</abbr> replaced by <abbr>COM</abbr> case with a negation affix;
* EXCEPTIVE <abbr>EXC</abbr> replaced by a new coordinative affix <abbr>CTR</abbr> meaning “except for; but (not)...”
* SEMBLATIVE <abbr>SBL</abbr> case = “as if (it were) X”, Distinguished from the ASSIMILATIVE to disambiguate phrases such as treat her as/like a princess having two different implications: (1) “...because she is a princess (or like one)” [ASSIMILATIVE] or (2) “...even though she isnʼt a princess (or doesnʼt look/act/seem like one)” [new SEMBLATIVE case]. **Now Use <abbr>ESS</abbr> and <abbr>ASI</abbr> instead**.

Differences From Ithkuil 2011:

* TERMINATIVE <abbr>TRM</abbr>: identifies a GOAL (whether circumstantial, sequential, figurative, spatial or temporal) [NOTE: the name TERMINATIVE has been reassigned from Ithkuil’s TERMINATIVE extension, which in turn has been renamed the ATTENTUATIVE in this language.]
* The SELECTIVE is renamed from Ithkuil’s EPISODIC <abbr>EPS</abbr> case and expanded to include spatial phenomena, e.g., every third book, every green one.
* CONFORMATIVE <abbr>CFM</abbr> case = ‘as per (the requirements of)’ = ‘in conformance with (the dictates of)’ = ‘as is necessitated by’ [split off from Ithkuil’s CONSIDERATIVE case]

Differences from Ithkuil 2011:

* ATTENDANT <abbr>ATD</abbr> case = ‘in the presence of X’, ‘before/with X’ = ‘in X’s presence’ [implies purposeful or a relational reference to X, different from LOCATIVE which only signifies location], e.g., the difference between ‘I am in my car’ (LOCATIVE) vs. ‘I am at my car’ (ATTENDANT), the latter implying “I’ve arrived at my car” or “My car is before me.”
* The PROCURSIVE <abbr>PSV</abbr> has been merged with the ORIENTATIVE (the former’s meaning occurs with static verbs, the latter’s meaning with verbs of motion).
* INTERRELATIVE <abbr>IRL</abbr> case: ‘spatially/temporally relative to’ [taken from the 2nd function of existing Ithkuil CORRELATIVE case]
