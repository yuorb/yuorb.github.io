This is similar to a case-frame, except that where case-frames function solely as an equivalent to subordinate clauses in Western languages, this adjunct causes the subsequent phrase to become a conventionalized, (quasi-)lexicalized gestalt. It thus serves as an equivalent to English phrasal gestalts (often hyphenated), as in the following examples:</p><ul><li><span class="glend">Hey, <b>shit-for-brains</b>! Stop your <b>stumbling-around-in-the-dark</b> behavior and watch how the <b>know-how-to-get-things-done</b> guy gets it done!</span></li><li><span class="glend">“Let the kid try, he’s from the neighborhood.” “O-oh! <b>“He’s from the neighborhood!”</b>”</span></li><li><span class="glend">Is that the actor who starred in that <b>aliens-invade-but-die-after-discovering-chocolate</b> movie?</span></li></ul>',4),he=e("code",null,"Cp",-1),ue=e("code",null,"Vc",-1),be=e("p",null,[e("strong",null,"hň")],-1),pe=e("p",null,"Same as Formative Slot IX",-1),fe=s('<p>Examples: <em>hňa</em>, <em>hňei</em>, <em>hňoa</em>, <em>hňeʼe</em>, <em>hňaʼu</em>, <em>hňiʼa</em></p><h2 id="Sec8_5" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec8_5"><span>8.5 Bias Adjuncts</span></a></h2><p>Bias adjuncts operate much like English “supra-segmental” interjections such as ‘Phew!’, ‘Damn!’, ‘tsk-tsk’, ‘Pssshhh’, ‘huh?’, ‘meh’, ‘hmmm’, etc. to establish a subjective “tone” or attitude toward a sentence as a whole. Unlike other adjuncts which function as substitutions for the morphological Slots within formatives, Bias adjuncts function independently from formatives and have semantic scope over the entire sentence <ins>when sentence-initially</ins> (again, much like Interjections in natural languages).</p><div class="hint-container warning"><p class="hint-container-title">Revisor’s Additional Info</p><p>During development, the grammar design document describes its scoping as follows:</p><p>Sentence-initial Bias adjuncts scope over the entire sentence. Otherwise, they scope over the preceding formative. They should be pronounced with a preceding and following pause.</p></div><p>Another unique quality of Bias adjuncts is that they violate the standard phonotactic rules of the language (again like the supera-segmental interjections of natural languages) by being purely consonantal in their phonetic make-up. They should be pronounced with a preceding and following pause. Each Bias adjunct has the same consonant-form as an associated lexico-semantic root phonologically structured to contain continuant and sonorant consonants so that when used as autonomous adjuncts, they may be pronounced in an exaggerated, prolonged fashion. Additionally, those ending in a voiceless stop or voiceless affricate may aspirate or even ejectivize the consonant. The Bias Adjuncts are listed below along with their meanings.</p><ul><li><abbr>ACC</abbr> ACCIDENTAL: lf <ul><li><span class="glend"><q>As luck would have it...</q><wbr><q>Fate has decided that...</q><wbr><q>What luck!</q></span></li></ul></li><li><abbr>ACH</abbr> ARCHETYPAL: mçt <ul><li><span class="glend">what (a) ...!; how . . .! ; Boy!
