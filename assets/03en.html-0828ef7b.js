These concepts are alien to other languages. While they deal with semantic distinctions which are quantitative in nature, these distinctions are usually made at the lexical level (i.e., via word choice) in other languages, not at the morphological level as in New Ithkuil. In this section we will deal first with Configuration, followed by Affiliation in Section 3.2 and Perspective in Section 3.3.</p><p>Specifically, Configuration deals with the physical similarity or relationship between members of a noun referent within groups, collections, sets, assortments, arrangements, or contextual gestalts, as delineated by internal composition, separability, compartmentalization, physical similarity or componential structure. This is best explained and illustrated by means of analogies to certain English sets of words.</p><p>Consider the English word ‘tree.’ In English, a single tree may stand alone out of context, or it may be part of a group of trees. Such a group of trees may simply be two or more trees considered as a plural category based on mere number alone, e.g., two, three, or twenty trees. However, it is the nature of trees to exist in more contextually relevant groupings than merely numerical ones. For example, the trees may be of like species as in a ‘grove’ of trees. The grouping may be an assortment of different kinds of trees as in a ‘forest’ or occur in patternless disarray such as a ‘jungle.’</p><p>As another example, we can examine the English word ‘person.’ While persons may occur in simple numerical groupings such as ‘a (single) person’ or ‘three persons’ it is more common to find persons (i.e., people) referred to by words which indicate various groupings such as ‘group,’ ‘gathering,’ ‘crowd,’ etc.</p><p>Segmentation and amalgamated componential structure are further configurative principles which distinguish related words in English. The relationships between &#39;car&#39; versus &#39;convoy&#39;, &#39;hanger&#39; versus &#39;rack&#39;, &#39;chess piece&#39; versus &#39;chess set&#39;, &#39;sentry&#39; versus &#39;blockade&#39;, &#39;piece of paper&#39; versus &#39;sheaf&#39;, &#39;girder&#39; versus &#39;(structural) framework&#39;, and &#39;coin&#39; versus &#39;roll of coins&#39; all exemplify these principles.</p><p>Another type of contextual grouping of nouns occurs in binary sets, particularly in regard to body parts. These binary sets can comprise two identical referents as in &#39;a pair of eyes&#39;, however they are more often opposed or “mirror-image” (i.e., complementary) sets as in &#39;limbs&#39;, &#39;ears&#39;, &#39;hands&#39;, &#39;wings&#39;, etc.</p><p>The semantic distinctions implied by the above examples as they relate to varying assortments of trees or persons would be accomplished by inflecting the word-stem for ‘tree’ or ‘person’ into one of twenty differnet configurations. Additional semantic distinctions on the basis of purpose or function between individual members of a set could then be made by means of Affiliation (see Section 3.2 below) and by the use of specific affixes. For example, once the words for ‘forest’ or ‘crowd’ were derived from ‘tree’ and ‘person’ via Configuration, the words for ‘orchard,’ ‘copse,’ ‘team’ or ‘mob’ could easily be derived via affiliation and affixes. (Such derivations into new words using affixes are explored in detail in Chapter 7: Affixes.)</p><p>The category of Configuration consists of the amalgamation of three separate factors: Plexity, Separability, and Similarity.</p><ul><li><p>Plexity is a three-way distinction as to whether an entity/event/act/state is single or internally unified, is binary or two-halved in nature, or has three or more components/pieces/parts/members. These three states of Plexity are termed UNIPLEX, DUPLEX, and MULTIPLEX (abbreviated as <code>U</code>, <code>D</code>, and <code>M</code>) .</p></li><li><p>Separability is a three-way distinction as to whether a group of entities when considered as a whole have individual members which are physically separate from each other, connected to each other in some way (whether physically or abstractly or metaphorically), or fused together (whether physically or abstractly or metaphorically). These three states of Separability are termed SEPARATE, CONNECTED, and FUSED (abbreviated as <code>S</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>F</code> as the second letter following the Plexity abbreviation letter). Note that Separability does not apply to UNIPLEX entities/events/acts/states.</p></li><li><p>Similarity is a three-way distinction as to whether a group of entities considered as a whole have individual members which are physically similar to each other, physically dissimilar to each other, or which together constitute a “fuzzy” category in terms of similarity (where the degree of similarity between individual members is subjective, unascertainable, irrelevant or not easily definable). These three states of Similarity are termed Similar, Dissimilar, and Fuzzy (abbreviated <code>S</code>, <code>D</code>, and <code>F</code> as the third letter following the Plexity and Separability abbreviation letters). Note that Similarity does not apply to UNIPLEX entities/events/acts/states.</p></li></ul><p>Based on the above, there are a total of twenty configurations, indicated via the <code>Ca</code> consonantal affix in Slot VI of the formative. Note that in addition to showing Configuration, this <code>Ca</code> affix also indicates the Affiliation, Perspective, Extension and Essence of the stem. The twenty configurations are shown below, each with its consonantal affix that appears in Slot VI of the formative:</p>',15),g=e("div",{class:"language-markdown","data-ext":"md"},[e("pre",{class:"language-markdown"},[e("code",null,`| UPX | uniplex                        | —* |

Affiliation operates synergistically in conjunction with Configuration to describe the total contextual relationship between the members of a set. Like Configuration, the meanings of nouns or verbs in the various affiliations often involve lexical changes when translated into English.</p><p>Returning to our earlier example of the word tree, we saw how a group of trees of the same species becomes &#39;a grove&#39; in the <code>MSC</code> configuration. The word &#39;grove&#39; implies that the trees have grown naturally, with no specific purpose or function in regard to human design or utilization. On the other hand, groves of trees may be planted by design, in which case they become &#39;an orchard&#39;. We saw how trees occurring as a natural assortment of different kinds is termed &#39;a forest&#39;. However, such assortments can become wholly chaotic, displaying patternless disarray from the standpoint of subjective human design, thus becoming &#39;a jungle&#39;.</p><p>As another example, we saw how the word &#39;person&#39; becomes &#39;group&#39;, or &#39;gathering&#39;, both of which are neutral as to subjective purpose or function. However, applying a sense of purposeful design generates words such as &#39;team&#39;, while the absence of purpose results in &#39;crowd&#39;.</p><p>There are four affiliations: CONSOLIDATIVE, <em>ASSOCIATIVE</em>, <em>VARIATIVE</em>, and <em>COALESCENT</em>. Like Configuration, Affiliation is also indicated as part of the <code>Ca</code> affix-complex in Slot VI of the formative. An Affiliation affix constitutes the first affix shown in the <code>Ca</code> affix-complex in Slot VI, immediately before the Configuration affix. The details of the four affiliations are explained below along with their affixes.</p><h3 id="_3-2-1-csl-the-consolidative" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-2-1-csl-the-consolidative" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 3.2.1 <code>CSL</code> The Consolidative</h3><p>The CONSOLIDATIVE affiliation is shown by a null affix, i.e., it is the absence of an Affiliation affix in slot VI that indicates CONSOLIDATIVE affiliation. This affiliation indicates that the individual members of a configurational set are a naturally occurring set where the function, state, purpose or benefit of individual members is inapplicable, irrelevant, or if applicable, is shared. It differs from the ASSOCIATIVE affiliation below in that the role of individual set members is not subjectively defined by human design. Examples are &#39;tree branches&#39;, &#39;a grove&#39;, &#39;a mound of rocks&#39;, &#39;some people&#39;, &#39;the clouds&#39;.</p><p>The CONSOLIDATIVE is also the affiliation normally applied to nouns in the UNIPLEX configuration when spoken of in a neutral way, since a noun in the UNIPLEX specifies one single entity without reference to a set, therefore the concept of “shared” function would be inapplicable. Examples: &#39;a man&#39;, &#39;a door&#39;, &#39;a sensation of heat&#39;, &#39;a leaf&#39;. With verbs, the CONSOLIDATIVE would imply that the act, state, or event is occurring naturally, or is neutral as to purpose or design.</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">例</p><p>čveţa</p><p><em>‘a bunch of tools’</em></p><p>arsweţ</p><p><em>‘a group of planets’</em></p><p>zvata</p><p><em>‘a set/group of similar dogs’</em></p><p>sřula</p><p><em>‘a room’s function’</em></p></div><h3 id="_3-2-2-aso-the-associative" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-2-2-aso-the-associative" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 3.2.2 ASO The Associative</h3><p>The ASSOCIATIVE affiliation is shown by the Slot VI-initial affix -l-, immediately followed by the Configuration affix. Note that if this affix is the only affix shown in the entire Slot VI <code>Ca</code> affix-complex, then it is instead shown by the stand-alone affix -nļ-. ASSOCIATIVE affiliation indicates that the individual members of a configurational set share the same subjective function, state, purpose or benefit. Its use can be illustrated by taking the word for “soldier” in MULTIPLEX configuration and comparing its English translations when inflected for the CONSOLIDATIVE affiliation (= a group of soldiers) versus the ASSOCIATIVE (= &#39;a troop&#39;, &#39;a platoon&#39;). It is this CONSOLIDATIVE versus ASSOCIATIVE distinction, then, that would distinguish otherwise equivalent inflections of the word for tree by translating them respectively as &#39;a grove&#39; versus &#39;an orchard&#39;.</p><p>The ASSOCIATIVE affiliation can also be used with nouns in the UNIPLEX configuration to signify a sense of unity amongst one’s characteristics, purposes, thoughts, etc. For example, the word &#39;person&#39; inflected for the UNIPLEX and ASSOCIATIVE would translate as &#39;a single-minded person&#39;. Even nouns such as &#39;rock&#39;, &#39;tree&#39; or &#39;work of art&#39; could be inflected this way, subjectively translatable as &#39;a well-formed rock&#39;, &#39;a tree with integrity&#39;, &#39;a “balanced” work of art&#39;.</p><p>With verbs, the ASSOCIATIVE signifies that the act, state or event is by design or with specific purpose. The CONSOLIDATIVE versus ASSOCIATIVE distinction could be used, for example, with the verb &#39;turn&#39; in &#39;I turned toward the window&#39; to indicate whether it was for no particular reason or due to a desire to look outside.</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">例</p><p>čvelţa</p><p><em>‘a well-designed set of tools’</em></p><p>arswelţ</p><p><em>‘an alliance of planets’</em></p><p>zvalta</p><p><em>‘a pack of similar dogs’</em></p><p>sřunļa</p><p><em>‘the room’s singular purpose’</em></p></div><h3 id="_3-2-3-coa-the-coalescent" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-2-3-coa-the-coalescent" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 3.2.3 <code>COA</code> The Coalescent</h3><p>The COALESCENT affiliation is shown by the Slot VI-initial affix -r-, immediately followed by the Configuration affix. Note that if this affix is the only affix shown in the entire Slot VI <code>Ca</code> affix-complex, then it is instead shown by the stand-alone affix -rļ-. The COALESCENT affiliation indicates that the members of a configurational set share in a complementary relationship with respect to their individual functions, states, purposes, benefits, etc. This means that, while each member’s function is distinct from those of other members, each serves in furtherance of some greater unified role. For example, the word translating English &#39;toolset&#39; would be the word for &#39;tool&#39; in the MDS (MULTIPLEX-DISSIMILAR/SEPARATE) configuration (due to each tool’s distinct physical appearance) and the COALESCENT affiliation to indicate that each tool has a distinct but complementary function in furtherance of enabling construction or repair activities. Another example would be the word for &#39;finger&#39; inflected for the <code>MSC</code> (MULTIPLEX-SIMILAR-CONNECTED) configuration and the COALESCENT affiliation, translatable as &#39;the fingers on one’s hand&#39; (note the use of the <code>MSC</code> configuration to imply the physical connection between each finger via the hand). A further example would be using the COALESCENT with the word for &#39;(piece of) food&#39; to signify &#39;a well-balanced meal&#39;.</p><p>The COALESCENT naturally appears most often in conjunction with the DUPLEX configuration since binary sets tend to be complementary. It is used, for example, to signify symmetrical binary sets such as body parts, generally indicating a lefthand/righthand mirror-image distinction, e.g., &#39;one’s ears&#39;, &#39;one’s hands&#39;, &#39;a pair of wings&#39;. Pairs that do not normally distinguish such a complementary distinction (e.g., &#39;one’s eyes&#39;) can nevertheless be optionally placed in the COALESCENT affiliation to emphasize bilateral symmetry (e.g., &#39;one’s left and right eye functioning together&#39;).</p><p>With verbs, the COALESCENT signifies that related, synergistic nature of the component acts, states, and events which make up a greater holistic act, state, or event. It imposes a situational structure onto an act, state, or event, where individual circumstances work together in complementary fashion to comprise the total situation. It would be used, for example, to distinguish the sentences &#39;He traveled in the Yukon&#39; from &#39;He ventured in the Yukon&#39;, or &#39;I came up with a plan&#39; versus &#39;I fashioned a plan&#39;.</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">例</p><p>čverţa</p><p><em>‘a toolset’</em></p><p>arswerţ</p><p><em>‘a confederation of planets’</em></p><p>zvarta</p><p><em>‘a dog team’</em></p><p>sřurļa</p><p><em>‘a room whose purposes are interrelated’</em></p></div><h3 id="_3-2-4-var-the-variative" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-2-4-var-the-variative" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 3.2.4 <code>VAR</code> The Variative</h3><p>The VARIATIVE affiliation is shown by the Slot VI-initial affix -ř-, immediately followed by the Configuration affix. Note that if this affix is the only affix shown in the entire Slot VI <code>Ca</code> affix-complex, then it is instead shown by the stand-alone affix -ň-. The VARIATIVE affiliation indicates that the individual members of a configurational set differ as to subjective function, state, purpose or benefit. The differences among members can be to varying degrees (i.e., constituting a fuzzy set in regard to function, purpose, etc.) or at complete odds with one another, although it should be noted that the VARIATIVE would not be used to signify opposed but complementary differences among set members (see the COALESCENT affiliation below). It would thus be used to signify &#39;a jumble of tools&#39;, &#39;odds-and-ends&#39;, &#39;a random gathering&#39;, &#39;a rag-tag group&#39;, &#39;a dysfunctional couple&#39;, &#39;a cacophony of notes&#39;, &#39;of a mess of books&#39;, &#39;a collection in disarray&#39;. It operates with nouns in the UNIPLEX to render meanings such as &#39;a man at odds with himself&#39;, &#39;an ill-formed rock&#39;, &#39;a chaotic piece of art&#39;, &#39;a “lefthand-righthand” situation&#39;.</p><p>With verbs, the VARIATIVE indicates an act, state, or event that occurs for more than one reason or purpose, and that those reasons or purposes are more or less unrelated. This sense can probably be captured in English only through paraphrase, as in &#39;She bought the house for various reasons&#39; or &#39;My being at the party served several purposes&#39;. With non-UNIPLEX configurations, the use of the VARIATIVE affiliation can describe rather complex phenomena; for example, a sentence using the <code>MSS</code> configuration such as &#39;The light is blinking&#39; in conjunction with the VARIATIVE would mean that each blink of the light signals something different than the preceding or following blinks.</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">例</p><p>čveřţa</p><p><em>‘a mish-mash of various tools’</em></p><p>arsweřţ</p><p><em>‘a disorganized group of planets’</em></p><p>zvařta</p><p>‘a rag-tag group of dogs’</p><p>sřuňa</p><p><em>‘a room with disparate purposes’</em></p></div><h2 id="_3-3-perspective" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-3-perspective" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 3.3 Perspective</h2><p>Perspective is the closest New Ithkuil equivalent to the Number category of most natural languages (i.e., singular, plural, collective, etc.). There are four perspectives: MONADIC, AGGLOMERATIVE, NOMIC, and ABSTRACT, shown respectively by the Slot VI affixes [null] (with stand-alone alternate of -l),-r-, -w- (with stand-alone alternate of -v), and -y- (with stand-alone alternate of -j). The Perspective affix comes last in the sequence of affixes contained in the Slot VI <code>Ca</code> affix-complex. The four perspectives are described below:</p><h3 id="_3-3-1-m-the-monadic" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-3-1-m-the-monadic" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 3.3.1 <code>M</code> The Monadic</h3><p>The MONADIC is unmarked in terms of an affix (i.e., a null affix), unless it is the only affix in the Slot VI <code>Ca</code> affix-complex, in which case its affix is -l-. It signifies a single embodiment of a particular configuration, meaning a contextual entity which, though possibly numerous in membership or multifaceted in structure, or spread out through a duration of time, is nevertheless being contextually viewed and considered as a “monad,” a single, unified whole. This is important, since configurations other than the UNIPLEX technically imply more than one discrete entity/instance being present or taking place. For nouns, this corresponds to what in Western languages would usually be singular number. For verbs, this can be thought of as a single instance/occurrence/manifestation of an act, event, or state.</p><p>Thus, using the word tree for example, while there might be many trees present in terms of number, the MONADIC means they form only one embodiment of whatever particular Configuration category is manifested.

All nouns are countable in New Ithkuil in that all nouns can exist as contextual monads. As a result, MONADIC nouns in New Ithkuil which refer to what are non-count nouns in other languages (or “collective” nouns such as ‘leaves’ or ‘hair’) must be translated into what linguists call the “singulative” mode, referring to the smallest salient single manifestation of the entity in question, e.g., ‘a drop of water’, ‘a speck of dust’, ‘a single hair’, ‘a single leaf’, ‘a puff/whiff of air’, ‘a single step/stride (of a walk/stroll)’, etc., whereas the more usual ways in which English and other languages express manifestations of non-count nouns as vague amounts are expressed in New ithkuil by the AGGLOMERATIVE perspective in Sec. 3.3.2 below, e.g., ‘some water’, ‘some dust’, ‘(one’s) hair’, ‘some leaves’, ‘the air (here)’.</p></div><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">例</p><p>avsal</p><p><em>‘a season’</em></p><p>ţrala</p><p><em>‘a drop of water’</em></p><p>elzeţ</p><p><em>‘different rivers’</em></p></div><h3 id="_3-3-2-g-the-agglomerative" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-3-2-g-the-agglomerative" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 3.3.2 <code>G</code> The Agglomerative</h3><p>The AGGLOMERATIVE is marked by the affix -r- as the last (or only) affix in Slot VI.

It is used when the specific number of an entity is irrelevant or the context of the utterance applies to either one or more than one of an entity.

The NOMIC refers to a generic collective entity or archetype, containing all members or instantiations of a configurative set throughout space and time (or within a specified spatio-temporal context). Since it is all members being spoken of, and no individual members in particular, this category is mutually exclusive from the MONADIC or AGGLOMERATIVE. For nouns, the NOMIC corresponds approximately to the several constructions used for referring to collective nouns in English, as seen in the sentences &#39;<u>The dog</u> is a noble beast&#39;, &#39;<u>Clowns</u> are what children love most&#39;, &#39;There is nothing like <u>a tree</u>&#39;.</p><p>With verbs, the NOMIC designates an action, event, or situation which describes a general law of nature or a persistently true condition or situation spoken of in general, without reference to a specific instance or occurrence of the activity (it is, in fact, all possible instances or occurrences that are being referred to). English has no specialized way of expressing such generic statements, generally using the simple present tense. Examples of usage would be &#39;The sun doesn&#39;t set on our planet&#39;, &#39;Mr. Okotele is sickly&#39;, &#39;In winter it snows a lot&#39;, &#39;That girl sings well&#39;.</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">例</p><p>avsav</p><p><em>‘a season’ (as a generic concept)</em></p><p>ţrava</p><p><em>‘water’ (as a generic concept)</em></p><p>elzeţwa</p><p><em>‘different rivers’ (as a generic concept)</em></p></div><h3 id="_3-3-4-a-the-abstract" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-3-4-a-the-abstract" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 3.3.4 <code>A</code> The Abstract</h3><p>The ABSTRACT is marked by the affix -y- in final position of Slot VI, unless it is the only affix in Slot VI, in which case the affix is -j-.

While only certain nouns in English can be made into abstracts via suffixes, all Ithkuil nouns in all Configurative categories can be made into abstracts, the translations of which must often be periphrastic in nature, e.g., &#39;grove&#39; → &#39;the idea of being a grove&#39; or “grovehood”; &#39;book&#39; → &#39;everything about books, having to do with books, involvement with books&#39;.</p>',7),ye=e("u",null,"Singing",-1),ve=e("u",null,"to worry about it",-1),we=e("u",null,"pouting",-1),xe=e("a",{href:"05#Sec5_2"},"Sec. 5.2",-1),Ie={href:"http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_affixes.pdf",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},Te=s('<div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">例</p><p>avsaj</p><p><em>‘everything about a season / “season-hood”’</em></p><p>ţraja</p><p><em>‘everything having to do with water’</em></p><p>elzeţya</p><p><em>‘different rivers as an idea’</em></p></div><h2 id="_3-4-extension" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-4-extension" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 3.4 Extension</h2><p>Extension is another morphological category for which there is no exact equivalent in other languages.

Another way to put it is that Extension indicates what “part” of an entity/act/event/state is being addressed or focused on. Extension is shown as part of a formative’s <code>Ca</code> affix in Slot VI which also indicates Configuration, Affiliation, Perspective and Essence.

It can be considered the neutral or default view, e.g., &#39;a tree&#39;, &#39;a grove&#39;, &#39;a set of books&#39;, &#39;an army&#39;. To illustrate a contextual example, the English sentence &#39;He climbed the ladder&#39; would be translated with the word &#39;ladder&#39; in the DELIMITIVE to show it is being considered as a whole.

It is best explained by reference to various English language illustrations. Compare the following pairs of English sentences:</p><p>(1a) The boy ran off to sea.</p><p>(1b) The boy who ran off to sea didn’t run off to sea.</p><p>(2a) The dog you saw is to be sold tomorrow.</p><p>(2b) The dog you saw doesn’t exist.</p><p>Sentences (1a) and (2a) appear to be straightforward sentences in terms of meaning and interpretation. However, at first blush, sentences (1b) and (2b) appear nonsensical, and it is not until we consider specialized contexts for these sentences that they make any sense. For example, (1b) would make sense if being spoken by an author reporting a change of mind about the plot for a story, while (2b) makes sense when spoken by a puzzled pet store owner in whose window you earlier saw a dog that is no longer there.</p><p>Why sentences such as (1b) and (2b) can have possible real-world meaning is because they in fact do not make reference to an actual boy or dog, but rather to hypothetical representations of a real-world boy and dog, being used as references back to those real-world counterparts from within an “alternative mental space” created psychologically (and implied linguistically) where events can be spoken about that are either unreal, as-yet-unrealized, or alternative versions of what really takes place. This alternative mental space, then, is essentially the psychological realm of both potential and imagination. In Western languages, such an alternative mental space is implied by context or indicated by certain lexical signals. One such group of lexical signals are the so-called “modal” verbs of English, e.g., &#39;must&#39;, &#39;can&#39;, &#39;should&#39;, etc. as seen in the following:</p><p>(3) You must come home at once.</p><p>(4) That girl can sing better than anybody.</p><p>(5) We should attack at dawn.</p><p>Each of the above three sentences describe potential events, not actual real-world happenings that are occurring or have occurred. For example, in Sentence (3) no one has yet come home nor do we know whether coming home is even possible, in Sentence (4) the girl may never sing a single note ever again for all we know, and Sentence (5) gives us no information as to whether any attack will actually occur.</p><h3 id="_3-5-1-nrm-the-normal-rpv-the-representative" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-5-1-nrm-the-normal-rpv-the-representative" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 3.5.1 <code>NRM</code> The Normal RPV The Representative</h3><p>The morphological category of Essence explicitly distinguishes real-world actualities from their alternative, imagined or potential counterparts.

Similarly excluded from consideration in the EXISTENTIAL is any notion of a noun’s use, function, role or benefit. The EXISTENTIAL serves only to point out the mere existence of a noun as a tangible, objective entity under discussion. It is thus used to offer mere identification of a noun or verb.</p><p>For example, consider the sentence &#39;A cat ran past the doorway&#39;. If the words corresponding to &#39;cat&#39;, &#39;run&#39;, and &#39;doorway&#39; are in the EXISTENTIAL, then the sentence merely describes an objective scene. No implication is intended concerning the subjective nature of the two entities or the action involved. The sentence is merely stating that two entities currently have a certain dynamic spatial relationship to each other; those two entities happen to be a cat and a doorway, and the running merely conveys the nature of the spatial relationship.</p><p>Frulawá warru přelu’a.</p><blockquote><p>‘parallel.translative.motion’-DYN/EXS-RTR-OBS ‘cat’-STA/EXS-IND ‘doorway’-STA/EXS-NAV</p></blockquote><p><em>‘The cat ran past the doorway.’</em> [ = neutral description of physical scene only]</p><h3 id="_3-9-2-fnc-the-functional" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-9-2-fnc-the-functional" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 3.9.2 FNC The Functional</h3><p>The FUNCTIONAL context focuses on those features of a formative that are defined socially by ideas, attitudes, beliefs, opinions, convention, cultural status, use, function, benefit, etc. It serves to identify not what a noun existentially is, but to show that the noun has specific (and subjective) contextual meaning, relevance or purpose.</p><p>For example, in our previous sentence &#39;A cat ran past the doorway&#39;, if we now place the cat, doorway, and act of running each into the FUNCTIONAL, the ‘cat’ no longer simply identifies a participant, it makes its being a cat (as opposed to say, a dog) significant, e.g., because the speaker may fear cats, or because the cat could get into the room and ruin the furniture, or because cats are associated with mystery, or because a neighbor has been looking for a lost cat, etc. The ‘doorway’ now conveys its purpose as an entry, reinforcing what the cat may do upon entering. Likewise, the verb ‘ran’ in the FUNCTIONAL now implies the furtive nature of the cat.</p><p>Fruilawá rrailu pře’ilua.</p><blockquote><p>‘parallel.translative.motion’-DYN/FNC-RTR-OBS ‘cat’-STA/FNC-IND ‘doorway’-STA/FNC-NAV</p></blockquote><p><em>‘The cat ran past the doorway.’</em> [ = focus on the personal or social meaning/significance of the cat, the running past, and the doorway]</p><h3 id="_3-9-3-rps-the-representational" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-9-3-rps-the-representational" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 3.9.3 RPS The Representational</h3><p>The REPRESENTATIONAL context focuses on a formative as a symbol, metaphor, or metonym, in that it indicates that the formative is serving as a representation or substitute for some other concept or entity which is abstractly associated with it. For example, the metaphorical connotations of the English sentence &#39;That pinstripe-suited dog is checking out a kitty&#39;, can be equally conveyed in Ithkuil by inflecting the words for ‘dog and ‘kitty’ into the REPRESENTATIONAL context.

It focuses on the systemic, holistic, gestalt-like, componential nature of a formative, implying that its objective and subjective totality is derived synergistically from (or as an emergent property of) the interrelationships between all of its parts, not just in terms of a static momentary appraisal, but in consideration of the entire developmental history of the noun and any interactions and relationships it has (whether past, present or potential) within the larger context of the world. Its use indicates the speaker is inviting the hearer to subjectively consider all the subjective wonder, emotional nuances, psychological ramifications and/or philosophical implications associated with the noun’s existence, purpose, or function, as being a world unto itself, intrinsically interconnected with the wider world beyond it on many levels.</p><p>Thus the AMALGAMATIVE version of our sentence &#39;The cat ran past the doorway&#39; would take on quite melodramatic implications, with the cat being representative of everything about cats and all they stand for, the doorway as being representative of the nature of doorways as portals of change, thresholds of departure, and the juncture of past and the future, while the act of running becomes representative of flight from enemies, rapidity of movement, the body at maximum energy expenditure, etc.</p><p>Froalawá rraolu přa’ölua.</p><blockquote><p>‘parallel.translative.motion’-DYN/AMG-RTR-OBS ‘cat’-STA/AMG-IND ‘doorway’-STA/AMG-NAV</p></blockquote><p><em>‘The cat ran past the doorway.’</em> [ = connotes a focus on the emotional impact plus cultural significance of the event]</p><h2 id="_3-10-restructuring-of-slots-i-and-ii-as-a-short-cut-for-slots-iv-and-vi" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-10-restructuring-of-slots-i-and-ii-as-a-short-cut-for-slots-iv-and-vi" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 3.10 Restructuring of Slots I and II as a “Short-Cut” for Slots IV and VI</h2><p>In certain circumstances, it is possible to shorten the number of syllables in a formative by eliminating the display of Slot IV and Slot VI and instead showing their morphological information by means of Slots I and II. Formatives containing this Slot IV/VI elision are termed “short-cut” formatives. This is explained below.</p><p>Slot I of a formative carries a consonantal prefix, <code>Cc</code>, that serves two functions: (1) to indicate whether the formative is a concatenated formative (explained in Chapter 8), and (2) to indicate whether certain <code>Vr</code>+<code>Ca</code> forms from Slots IV and VI have been elided (thus being instead indicated by the Slot I <code>Cc</code> affix and Slot II <code>Vv</code> affix).</p><p>The default value of Slot I is a glottal stop (’), which is unwritten in the language’s romanization scheme whenever in word-initial position. (Note that this means that no formative begins with a vowel-sound; any formative written with an initial vowel in the romanized writing system is to be pronounced with a preceding glottal-stop.)
