Unlike other adjuncts which function as substitutions for the morphological Slots within formatives, Bias adjuncts function independently from formatives and have semantic scope over the entire sentence <ins>when sentence-initially</ins> (again, much like Interjections in natural languages).</p><div class="hint-container warning"><p class="hint-container-title">Revisor’s Additional Info</p><p>During development, the grammar design document describes its scoping as follows:</p><p>Sentence-initial Bias adjuncts scope over the entire sentence. Otherwise, they scope over the preceding formative. They should be pronounced with a preceding and following pause.</p></div><p>Another unique quality of Bias adjuncts is that they violate the standard phonotactic rules of the language (again like the supera-segmental interjections of natural languages) by being purely consonantal in their phonetic make-up. They should be pronounced with a preceding and following pause. Each Bias adjunct has the same consonant-form as an associated lexico-semantic root phonologically structured to contain continuant and sonorant consonants so that when used as autonomous adjuncts, they may be pronounced in an exaggerated, prolonged fashion. Additionally, those ending in a voiceless stop or voiceless affricate may aspirate or even ejectivize the consonant. The Bias Adjuncts are listed below along with their meanings.</p><ul><li><abbr>ACC</abbr> ACCIDENTAL: lf <ul><li><span class="glend">“As luck would have it...”<wbr>“Fate has decided that...”<wbr>“What luck!”</span></li></ul></li><li><abbr>ACH</abbr> ARCHETYPAL: mçt <ul><li><span class="glend">what (a) ...!; how . . .! ; Boy!
