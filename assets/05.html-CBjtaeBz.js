id="Sec5_1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec5_1"><span>5.1 Valence</span></a></h2><p>The term <strong>Valence</strong> as used in this grammar refers to the manner of participation of two separate entities or parties to any given verb, i.e., participation by one party automatically implies participation by another party to the same act, event, or state in either a parallel, corollary, or complementary fashion. Such dual participation occurs naturally in the verbs of world languages and is the province of what is known as “co-active” verbs. While all languages implicitly have co-active verbs, Ithkuil explicitly shows this dual participation in a formal and systematic way. To illustrate the concept of co-activity in English compare the following pairs of sentences:</p><div class="indent"><p>(1a)<q>I found an old man.</q><br> → (1b)<q>I found an empty can.</q><br> (2a)<q>I threw the ball at Sam.</q><br> → (2b)<q>I threw the ball at the window.</q><br> (3a)<q>I performed in front of her.</q><br> → (3b)<q>I performed in front of the wall.</q></p></div><p>Note that the first member of each sentence pair has an animate object of the verb (<em>an old man</em>, <em>Sam</em>, and <em>her</em>), while the second member of each pair has an inanimate object (<em>an empty can</em>, <em>the window</em>, and <em>the wall</em>). Now compare this set of sentence pairs to the similar set below:</p><div class="indent"><p>(1c)<q>I met an old man.</q><br> → (1d) *<q>I met an empty can.</q><br> (2c)<q>I threw Sam the ball.</q><br> → (2d) *<q>I threw the window the ball.</q><br> (3c)<q>I entertained her.</q><br> → (3d) *<q>I entertained the wall.</q></p></div><p>The asterisk * indicates that the second sentence of these pairs is semantically unacceptable to English speakers. Why? The second set of sentence pairs parallel the first set except that the verbs <em>find</em>, <em>throw at</em>, and <em>perform</em> have been replaced by the semantically similar <em>meet</em>, <em>throw</em>, and <em>entertain</em>. Nevertheless, the use of inanimate objects with these latter three verbs appears unacceptable. The reason is that the verbs in the first set are “mono-active,” i.e., they do not require that the object participate in the action in any way, whereas the verbs in the second set are “co-active,” requiring that the object participate in the action along with the subject. Thus, while I can <em>find</em> an old man without the old man doing anything about it or even being aware of it, I cannot <em>meet</em> an old man without the old man also meeting me. I can <em>throw a ball at Sam</em> without Sam noticing, but if I <em>throw Sam a ball</em> it implies that he is expected to participate by catching it.</p><p>Similarly, I can perform in front of someone even if they’re asleep, but I can’t entertain them unless they are participating in the situation by observing me. The participatory relationship involving the second party of a co-active verb differs depending on the context. It can be a parallel relationship (i.e., both parties participate identically) as implied by the English adverb ‘together’ in <em>He and I jog together</em>, or a reciprocal relationship as in the sentence <em>I met the old man</em> (i.e., and so he met me) or in verbs used with the adverbial phrase ‘each other,’ as in <em>We love each other</em>. The relationship can be one of accompaniment as in <em>I played along with him</em> (e.g., as he sang), or a complementary relationship as in <em>I threw Sam the ball</em> (i.e., and so he caught it).</p><p>Other sorts of co-active relationships are possible. It is the differences in these relationships that are systematized in Ithkuil into the category called Valence. In English and other languages co-activity is rarely explicit and systematic (the use of adverbs such as ‘together,’ ‘each other,’ or prefixes such as ‘out-’ as in <em>out-perform</em> are some exceptions), and when lexified within a verb itself, are implicitly specific to that verb, giving rise to monoactive/co-active pairs such as <em>find/meet</em>, <em>throw at/throw</em>, <em>perform/entertain</em>, etc. In Ithkuil, co-activity is explicitly shown morphologically, and the types of co-active relationships, i.e., the valences of the verb, are systematic and fully productive for all verbs. As a result, no mono-active versus co-active lexical distinctions are necessary, i.e., all verbs can function monoactively as well as co-actively.</p><p>There are nine valences in New Ithkuil: the <strong>MONOACTIVE</strong>, <strong>PARALLEL</strong>, <strong>COROLLARY</strong>, <strong>RECIPROCAL</strong>, <strong>COMPLEMENTARY</strong>, <strong>DUPLICATIVE</strong>, <strong>DEMONSTRATIVE</strong>, <strong>CONTINGENT</strong>, and <strong>PARTICIPATIVE</strong>. Valence is shown by the vocalic <code>Vn</code> affix in formative Slot VIII. Note that the presence of a <code>Vn</code> affix in Slot VIII requires that it be immediately followed by a consonantal CN affix denoting either the category of Mood (see <a href="05#Sec5_2">Sec. 5.2</a> below) or Case-Scope (see <a href="04#Sec4_10">Sec. 4.10</a>).

Example moods common to Western languages include the indicative (factual utterances), subjunctive (showing doubt or probability, expressed by ‘may/might’ in English), imperative (indicating commands, e.g., <em>Go now!</em>, <em>Sing it for us!</em>), conditional (expressing hypotheticals, e.g., <em>She would travel if she could</em>), optative (indicating wishes, hopes, expectations, e.g., <em>I wish he’d go</em>, <em>I expect him to be here</em>), and hortative (indicating exhortations, e.g., <em>May he live 100 years!</em> <em>Let them see for themselves!</em>).</p><p>In New Ithkuil, moods simply convey a two-fold distinction as to whether the factuality of an utterance is certain or uncertain, combined with a three-way distinction as to whether the factuality of an explicit or implicit assumption underlying the utterance (i.e., a presupposition) is true, false, or unknown. This twofold by threefold matrix renders a total of six moods: the <strong>FACTUAL</strong>, <strong>SUBJUNCTIVE</strong>, <strong>ASSUMPTIVE</strong>, <strong>SPECULATIVE</strong>, <strong>COUNTERFACTIVE</strong>, and <strong>HYPOTHETICAL</strong>, explained below.</p><p>Mood is shown via the <code>Cn</code> affix in Slot VIII, immediately following the <code>Cn</code> affix. Note that this is the same affix that shows Case-Scope in nominal formatives (i.e., nouns), as already described in Sec. 4.10. The determination as to whether a formative is a noun or verb can be made by its syllabic stress pattern. For our purposes here, verbal formatives where the <code>Cn</code> affix in Slot VIII shows Mood will always be stressed on the final syllable of the word. This is explained in detail in <a href="06#Sec6_2_1">Sec. 6.2.1</a> on Relation.</p><h3 id="Sec5_2_1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec5_2_1"><span>5.2.1 <abbr>FAC</abbr> The Factual</span></a></h3><p>The <strong>FACTUAL</strong> mood is the default mood and is unmarked if Slot VIII is otherwise unfilled/unmarked. Otherwise, it is marked by the <code>Cn</code> affix -<strong>h</strong>- in Slot VIII. The FACTUAL mood signifies that the factuality of the speaker’s statement is certain and that there either is no underlying presupposition to the statement, or if there is, its factuality is also certain or has no bearing on the factuality of the statement.

It indicates that the factuality of an explicit or implicit presupposition underlying the statement is certain, but the factuality of the speaker’s statement itself is questionable or uncertain, the specific nuance of factuality intended being subject to the particular Bias and Validation associated with the verb. Corresponds roughly with English ‘may,’ ‘maybe’ or ‘might,’ with the added distinction that an explicit or implicit (i.e., underlying) presupposition is true.

It functions identically to the FACTUAL except that the factuality of an underlying presupposition is unknown. It therefore conveys an act, state, or event whose factuality is dependent on whether something else is factual, thus corresponding to certain usages of English ‘maybe’ and ‘will’ (where ‘will’ primarily conveys possibility, not future tense). As with all moods, the specific translation is subject to the particular Bias and Validation associated with the verb.

Many languages morphologically indicate degrees of comparison as exemplified by the English suffixes -<em>er</em> and -<em>est</em> seen in <em>great-greater-greatest</em>, or alternately with the adverbs <em>more</em> and <em>most</em>, as well as their negative counterparts <em>less</em> and <em>least</em>. The New Ithkuil comparison schema is much more complex than those found in natural languages and is designed to eliminate various ambiguities that arise from those simpler schemata, as discussed below.</p><h3 id="Sec5_5_1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec5_5_1"><span>5.5.1 Ambiguity and Under-Specification in Natural Languages</span></a></h3><p>The comparison schemata of natural languages tend to grossly under-specify the exact semantic nature of the comparison. A clear case of such under-specification can be seen in an English example sentence such as <em>Jane is healthier</em>. This sentence can mean any of the following:</p><div class="indent"><ol><li>Jane’s state of health has improved, although she is still unwell.</li><li>Jane’s state of health has improved so that now she is well (whereas before she was unwell).</li><li>Jane’s state of health is even better than it previously was (i.e., she was healthy before, but is even healthier now).</li><li>Jane’s state of health is not as poor as someone else’s state of health (although neither Jane nor the other person are well).</li><li>Jane’s state of health is better than someone else’s state of health, so that Jane can be considered healthy while the other is unwell.</li><li>Jane’s state of health is better than someone else’s state of health, even though both can be considered healthy.</li></ol></div><p>This ambiguity is not alleviated even when we specify a party to which Jane’s health is being compared as in <em>Jane is healthier than Sue</em>, which can mean:</p><div class="indent abc"><ol><li>Jane’s state of health is not as poor as Sue’s although both are unwell.</li><li>Jane’s state of health is better than Sue’s, so that Jane can be considered well while Sue is unwell.</li><li>Both Jane and Sue are healthy, but Jane’s state of health is even better than Sue’s.</li><li><del>Jane’s state of health is not as poor as Sue’s (although neither Jane nor the other person are well).</del></li></ol></div><p>This sort of ambiguity allows odd-sounding sentences such as <em>Snow is warmer</em> (e.g., than liquid nitrogen) to be perfectly grammatical. What is important to note about the above analysis is that the words <em>healthier</em> or <em>warmer</em> do not indicate in the actual context of usage <em>whether a person is actually healthy</em> or <em>whether snow is actually warm</em>. Rather English -<em>er</em> and -<em>est</em> (and <em>more</em> and <em>most</em>) as well as their negative counterparts (<em>less</em> and <em>least</em>) merely serve to indicate <em>on a relative scale</em> a relationship between two entities being compared (or where only one party is mentioned, in relationship to some unspecified standard or expectation). Additional statements are needed to clarify the actual context to determine where the entities fall on the quantitative &quot;spectrum&quot; or range of the particular quality or attribute pair in question, e.g., <em>unhealthy</em> &lt;—&gt; <em>healthy</em>.</p><p>The New Ithkuil comparison scheme inherently specifies such relative comparison while simultaneously specifying placement within the qualitative spectrum, so that ambiguity as to whether “healthier” means the person is well or unwell is eliminated.</p><h3 id="Sec5_5_2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec5_5_2"><span>5.5.2 Relative Versus Absolute Comparison</span></a></h3><p>An additional aspect of New Ithkuil comparison is the concept of <strong>relative comparison</strong> versus <strong>absolute comparison</strong>. This is an important concept which impacts the truth value of a statement based upon context. Specifically, relative comparison allows for statements to be true within the narrow confines of the context-at-hand, whereas absolute comparison allows for statements to be true without reference to any specific context. This can be illustrated by the following examples.</p><div class="indent abc"><ol><li>Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky.</li><li>That highway is the fastest way into town.</li></ol></div><p>Both of these sentences are true in certain pragmatic contexts and not true in others. For example, while Sirius is the most luminous star as seen from Earth, this is merely due to its relative nearness to Earth (8.4 light years) as compared to most other stars. There are thousands of known stars which are larger (and inherently more luminous) than Sirius but are much further away from Earth. So Sentence (a) is true in a relative context but false in an absolute context. Similarly the highway in Sentence (b) may be the fastest way in most conditions, but if there is a traffic jam or an accident blocking the highway, or if one has access to a private helicopter, then the statement would be false. Therefore, it is only true in a narrow context determined by the pragmatics of the moment it is spoken. New Ithkuil allows speakers to specify whether a comparison is to be interpreted within the context-at-hand (relative comparison) or as an absolute statement irrespective of the context-at-hand.</p><h3 id="Sec5_5_3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec5_5_3"><span>5.5.3 Comparison Operators (Levels)</span></a></h3><p>There are nine comparison operators for the Ithkuil verb, called <strong>Levels</strong>, which specify the comparative relationship involved, e.g., same as, more than, less than, etc. Relative Level is shown by the vocalic <code>Vn</code> affix value in Slot VIII. The nine <code>Vn</code> values showing Phase are different from those showing Valence, Phase, or Effect above, i.e., showing Valence, Phase, Effect or Level via the VN affix value in Slot VIII are all mutually exclusive, meaning that if Slot VIII shows Level, it cannot show Valence, Phase or Effect. (Note that it is possible to show these categories on a formative by other means, as will be detailed in the Chapter on Adjuncts.) The nine Effects are described below, with examples of their use shown in Sec. 5.5.4.</p><p>In interpreting the meaning of the various Levels, the terms used in the formulas below refer to the following <strong>X-M-(Y)</strong> model, where M represents a verb or an adjectival description, X is the “subject” of the verb, and Y is the standard being compared to.</p><div class="indent"><dl

Nevertheless, while New Ithkuil has morphology which does more or less convey such tense-like information, such morphology is generally optional and is usually unnecessary, as it is often either inferred by the contextual logic of the situation being described by the sentence, or, more importantly, is often irrelevant to an understanding of the semantic content of the sentence. Unlike Western languages whose grammars require that verbs denote a tense, sentences in New Ithkuil only specify such temporal information if it is genuinely necessary for the proper comprehension of the sentence’s context. If a sentence can convey its communicative point without the need for extraneous specification as to “when” it takes place, then no such temporal information is specified.</p><p>As an example, compare the following two similar Ithkuil sentences which differ only in the subtle choice between using CONCLUSIVE aspect versus CULMINATIVE aspect.</p><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>Ätrulaöwá</dt><dd>CPT-“translative.motion”-DYN-[default Ca]-<b>CCL</b>-OBS</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>dře</dt><dd>2p+1m/DET-ABS</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>Hakšivé-Warswiʼa.</dt><dd>CONCATENATED:“clown”-OBJ-N-COR-PARENT:[default Ca]-PRC-“planet”-LOC</dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>We’ve ended up on the Clown Planet.</q></div></div><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>Ätruleowá</dt><dd>CPT-“translative.motion”-DYN-[default Ca]-<b>CUL</b>-OBS</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>dře</dt><dd>2p+1m/DET-ABS</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>Hakšivé-Warswiʼa.</dt><dd>CONCATENATED:“clown”-OBJ-N-COR-PARENT:[default Ca]-PRC-“planet”-LOC</dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>We eventually wound up on the Clown Planet.</q></div></div><p>Notice that the translation of the first sentence utilizes the English “present perfect” tense (i.e., “have” + past participle) while the second sentence is translated using simple past tense. Yet the interlinear analysis of both New ithkuil sentences shows that neither one of them specifies any “tense” informtion whatsoever whether past, present, future, or any equivalent to Western “perfective” forms. So why the differing choices of tense when translating these two sentences into English?</p><p>In the absense of any morphology specifically denoting a temporal position along a progressive linear timeline, a New Ithkuil sentence is considered to be describing something as manifesting/taking place in the speaker’s (and addressee’s) contextual present moment. So the first sentence is indicating that at the present moment the speaker and addressee find themselves on the Clown Planet. However, the use of CONCLUSIVE aspect indicates that the particular present state of affairs has arisen as the result of events during the short time immediately prior to the present moment. The English present perfect tense is convenient in conveying such a situation where the act/event/state in the present moment is a direct outcome of the immediately preceding short-term events (where those preceding short-term events can be considers part of a larger “present”-tense context).</p><p>In the second sentence, however, use of the CULMINATIVE aspect implies that the present state of affairs is the outcome of a long drawn-out process or series of events extending back into the past, so that rather than the preceding events being short-term and considered part of a larger “present” context, here the present moment is seen as being part of a larger “past” context. Consequently, the semantics of the second New Ithkuil sentence are better translated into English using the past tense.</p><h3 id="Sec5_7_1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec5_7_1"><span>5.7.1 Combinations of Aspect, Extension, and Perspetive</span></a></h3><p>Despite the discussion above explaining why conveying “tense”-like information in New Ithkuil is both optional and unusual, nevertheless, the language does provide morphology to do so, if necessary.
