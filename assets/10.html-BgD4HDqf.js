Most of these specialized constructions constitute alternative or “short-cut” means of expressing more long-winded “standard” constructions, although some represent standard expressions in and of themselves.</p><h2 id="Sec10_1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec10_1"><span>10.1 Concatenation and Format</span></a></h2><p>Many languages, including English, are able to combine two separate meanings into a single verb, a process termed <strong>conflation</strong>. This is illustrated in the following English sentences:</p><div class="indent"><ol><li><q>He bicycled south</q> = He traveled south by bicycle.</li><li><q>She dolled herself up</q> = She made herself look as pretty as a doll.</li><li><q>They’re shelving the books</q> = They’re putting the books on the shelf/shelves.</li><li><q>Slide me a beer</q> = Give me a beer by sliding it (e.g., along the bar)</li></ol></div><p>The above sentences show four verbs which respectively carry inherent senses of vector movement, transformation, positioning/placement, and giving. The patterning of such “conflated” verbs is usually random and haphazard in any given language. For example, the English <em>to bicycle</em> in sentence (1) means ‘to travel by means of bicycle,’ not ‘to make a bicycle’ or ‘to be a bicycle.’ On the other hand, the verb <em>to doll up</em> does not mean to ‘travel by doll,’ but rather ‘to make appear like a doll.’ Yet, <em>to shelve</em> means ‘to place on a shelf,’ not ‘to travel by means of shelves’ or ‘to make appear like a shelf.’ And none of the verbs in the first three sentences connotes the idea of giving or conveyance as does <em>slide</em> in sentence (4).</p><p>As can be seen, verb conflation is essentially a “short-cut” way of combining an unspoken primary verbal sense (such as movement, transformation, placement, giving, etc.) with an overtly expressed verb that conveys a secondary sense such as means, manner, or location. This can be formally notated for our four sentences above as follows:</p><div class="indent"><ul><li>He [1: (TRAVEL+past tense) south] [2: (BY-MEANS-OF) bicycle]<br> = <em>He bicycled south.</em></li><li>She [1: (CAUSE-TO-RESEMBLE+past tense+reflexive)] [2: (IN-THE-MANNER-OF) doll]<br> = <em>She dolled herself up.</em></li><li>They [1: (PUT+progressive) the books] [2: (TO-LOCATION-OF) shelves]<br> = <em>They’re shelving the books.</em></li><li>[1: (GIVE+imperative)] a beer [2: (BY-MEANS-OF) sliding] to me<br> = <em>Slide me a beer.</em></li></ul></div><p>Note that the particular unspoken covert and overt senses (shown by the numerals 1 and 2 in the above analyses) are specific to any given verb and must be subjectively learned by the listener, i.e., a speaker of English must learn that <em>to hand</em> means to GIVE by MEANS of one’s hand, but <em>to shoulder</em> does not mean to GIVE by MEANS of one’s shoulder.</p><p>Thus, while conflation of verbs presents a potential opportunity for instantiating verbs with patterns of overt and covert meaning, the lack of systemization prevents one from knowing with certainty what pattern to use when attempting to interpret the usage of a verb form.</p><p>New Ithkuil systemizes verb conflation into a productive scheme, in which any formative can be concatenated directly with another formative (termed the parent formative). The operational sense of the concatenated formative and its semantic relation to the parent formative is conveyed by its case-affix in Slot IX. The concatenated formative is placed immediately preceding the parent formative, and is structured as a regular formative, able to take any and all morphology as appropriate and semantically permissible for the concatenated pair as a whole. The concatenated formative also shows one of the following eight <code>Cc</code> values in Slot I to indicate that it and the following formative constitute a concatenated pair. The meaning of the different <code>Cc</code> values is explained below the table.</p><div class="table-3"><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center;"></th><th style="text-align:center;">Slot IX = <code>Vf</code></th><th style="text-align:center;">+ w-form of <code>Ca</code> shortcut*</th><th style="text-align:center;">+ y-form of <code>Ca</code> shortcut*</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center;">Type-1 Concatenation</td><td style="text-align:center;">h</td><td style="text-align:center;">hl</td><td style="text-align:center;">hm</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center;">Type-2 Concatenation</td><td style="text-align:center;">hw</td><td style="text-align:center;">hr</td><td style="text-align:center;">hn</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>* See <a href="03#Sec3_10">Sec. 3.10</a> for an explanation of the <strong>w</strong>- and <strong>y</strong>- <code>Ca</code> shortcuts</p><h4 id="format" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#format"><span>Format</span></a></h4><p>Note that for a concatenated formative, the Slot IX case affix is labeled <code>Vf</code> rather than <code>Vc</code> to stand for the term <strong>Format</strong>. Although <code>Vf</code> affixes are the same as <code>Vc</code> case affixes and represent the same 68 noun cases from Chapter 4 above, the term Format rather than Case is used to differentiate the fact that the case relationship is performing a different function. Specifically, the Format specifies the semantic relationship the concatenated formative has <em>with the immediately-following parent formative</em>, as opposed to signifying any case relationship it has to the rest of the sentence (which is the purpose of the Slot IX <code>Vc</code> / <code>Vk</code> affix in the parent formative).</p><h4 id="alternate-vf-indicator" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#alternate-vf-indicator"><span>Alternate <code>Vf</code> Indicator</span></a></h4><p>Concatenated formatives do not use a glottal-stop in the Slot IX <code>Vf</code> form for Cases 37 through 68 (i.e., the Relational, Affinitive, Spatio-Temporal I, or Spatio-Temporal II cases). Instead, the concatenated formative takes ultimate syllabic stress to indicate that the Slot IX <code>Vf</code> Format vowel is actually a Format 37-through-68 form but without the glottal stop. Also, both Case No. 1 <abbr>THM</abbr> and Case No. 37 <abbr>PRN</abbr> can elide their -<strong>a</strong>- phonological marker; the latter only as long as the resulting word bears ultimate syllabic stress and is not mono-syllabic. Before eliding the -<strong>a</strong>-, External Juncture requirements as per <a href="11#Sec11_8">Sec. 11.8</a> must be taken into account. A monosyllabic concatenated formative is to be interpreted as an unframed nominal formative bearing case (whereas a monosyllabic parent or standalone formative is interpreted as a verbal formative).</p><h3 id="Sec10_1_1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec10_1_1"><span>10.1.1 Concatenation Type</span></a></h3><p>As seen in the above table, there are two types of concatenation. Type-1 concatenation implies a circumstantial relationship between the concatenated formative and the parent (equivalent to placing the concatenated formative into a case-frame). Type-2 concatenation is derivational (i.e., lexicalizing), creating a new lexico-semantic gestalt usually requiring a different English translation. This is analogous to English forms like <em>polar bear</em> naming a new animal rather than stating a location. Likewise, English <em>elephant seal</em> establishes a new lexico-semantic gestalt rather than describing some sort of metaphorical relationship between elephants and seals.</p><h3 id="Sec10_1_2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec10_1_2"><span>10.1.2 <code>Ca</code> Shortcut Indicator for Concatenated Formative</span></a></h3><p>Columns 2 and 3 of the above table are used if the Slot IV <code>Vr</code> value is default -<strong>a</strong>- <abbr>STA/BSC/ESS</abbr> and the Slot VI <code>Ca</code> affix is one of eight specific <code>Ca</code> values shown for Slot II as previously described in <a href="03#Sec3_10">Sec. 3.10</a>.</p><h3 id="Sec10_1_3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec10_1_3"><span>10.1.3 Concatenation Chain</span></a></h3><p>More than two formatives may be concatenated to form the equivalent of phrasal concatenation or a concatenation chain.

Examples:</p><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>Mmiexinļ</dt><dd>PVS​-PUR​-(IRG)</dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>Why?</q><br>[i.e., For what purpose?]</div><dl class="gloss"><dt>Mmaʼoxinļ</dt><dd>PVS​-CNR​-(IRG)</dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>When?</q></div><dl class="gloss"><dt>Nnioxinļ</dt><dd>PVS.BEN​-TRA​-(IRG)</dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>To/for whose benefit? / To the benefit of what?</q></div><dl class="gloss"><dt>Ňňeöxinļ</dt><dd>PVS.DET​-RSL​-(IRG)</dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>Resulting (detrimentally) in what? / With what undesirable result?</q></div><dl class="gloss"><dt>Mmauxinļ</dt><dd>PVS​-PRP​-(IRG)</dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>Whose? / Belonging to what?</q></div></div><p>Finally, one can form the equivalent of WH-questions using INTERROGATIVE Illocution in conjunction with a formative affixed with Degrees 1, 2, 3, 8 or 9 of the <abbr>PTN</abbr> affix shown below. When used this way, the formative carrying the <abbr>PTN</abbr> affix must be marked as the semantic focus of the sentence (i.e., it must either immediately precede the verb in terms of word-order or it must carry the <abbr>TPF/9</abbr> affix).</p>',4),Z={class:"hint-container details"},K={class:"t"},J=e("abbr",null,"PTN",-1),Q=e("ol",null,[e("li",null,"whatever X is / whatever X may be"),e("li",null,"whatever X was or may have been (but is no more)"),e("li",null,"whatever X will be or may become (but is not yet)"),e("li",null,"...or something like/similar to X in function, purpose, or consequence"),e("li",null,"...or something like/similar to X in appearance/description"),e("li",null,"and whatever else X may be(come)"),e("li",null,"and whatever else X entails or carries with it as a consequence"),e("li",null,"which(ever) X (it is or may be) [i.e., of a known/limited number of possible identifications available to assign to X, the one identification that actually is (chosen as) X]"),e("li",null,"what(ever) X (it is or may be) [i.e., of an unknown number of possible identifications one might/could assign to X, the one identification that actually is (chosen as) X]")],-1),$=d('<p>Examples:</p><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>Weilüsve</dt><dd>S2.G-“human child”-<b>PTN/8₁</b>-ABS</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>erčuléi</dt><dd>S2-“corruption/subversion/undermining”-DYN-<b>IRG</b></dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>kšilo?</dt><dd>S1-“performing as a clown”-OBJ-ERG</dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>Which of the children did the clown corrupt?</q></div><dl class="gloss"><dt>Laluţkusvu</dt><dd>S1-“adult human”-MAK/9₁-<b>PTN/9₁</b>-IND</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>utxoléi</dt><dd>S3-“drinking liquid”-DYN.CSV-<b>IRG</b></dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>akftyäloë?</dt><dd>S1-“ammonia”-CTE-CSM</dd></dl><div class="glend"><q>What kind of person drinks ammonia?</q></div></div><h2 id="Sec10_7" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec10_7"><span>10.7 Using Case on UNFRAMED Verbal Formatives</span></a></h2><p>Using the case-stacking affix (see <a href="07#Sec7_6">Sec. 7.6</a>), a noun-case can be placed on an UNFRAMED verbal formative to give a meaning of “to be (something that is) X” where X is the formative modified by the case’s function.

For example, imagine the manager of a basement nightclub talking to a friend on the sidewalk outside his club. He invites the friend to the balcony outside the back of the club, which one gets to by descending into the club, going past the dance floor, up a flight of stairs, then along a hallway to the back door. He does so by saying the following sentence to his friend, containing a string of nine prepositions (the first eight of which are functioning as adverbial particles):</p><div style="text-align:center;"><p><q>Come on down inside, up along through out back to the balcony.</q></p></div><p>New Ithkuil allows a speaker to create similar succinct “moving images”. Each motion root (whether referring to in-situ or translative motion) has a corresponding <code>VxCs</code> affix of the same form (e.g., for the root -<strong>KR</strong>- ‘OBLIQUE LINEAR MOTION’, there is a corresponding affix -<strong>kr</strong>). Each of these affixes has the following nine degrees:</p><details class="hint-container details"><summary>Degree Of Motion Affix</summary><ol><li><strong>Motion through X</strong>. Specifically, interior perlative motion/movement in a manner described by the affix’s corresponding root among/within an external/surrounding/underlying (quasi-)static medium. For translative motion affixes, implies motion along a course described by the affix’s corresponding root where the course is set, determined, or prescribed by an externally surrounding/underlying medium/channel, etc.</li><li><strong>Motion like X, inside something</strong>. Specifically, interior motion/movement: in-situ or translative movement/motion in a manner described by the affix’s corresponding root while inside another entity (where, unlike Degree 1, the exterior object/entity does not define/prescribe/determine the course of the moving object/entity.)</li><li><strong>Motion into X</strong>. Implies entry from an exterior space/medium/context into an interior space/medium/context</li><li><strong>Motion like X</strong>; for translative motion affixes, <strong>motion along X</strong>. Implies continued/continuous movement in a manner described by the affix’s corresponding root; for translative motion affixes, implies continued/continuous motion along a course/direction described by the affix’s corresponding root</li><li><strong>Motion like X from one point (across) to another</strong>. Implies a single motion in a manner described by the affix’s corresponding root from one point/side of the contextual space to another; for translative motion affixes, implies a single motion along a course/direction described by the affix’s corresponding root across a gap/gulf/space from one place to another.</li><li>Translative Motion = <strong>move onward</strong>; Positional: <strong>X/Y/Z position of X</strong>. For translative motion affixes, signifies motivational “on” as in “come on”, “go on”, “move on” - implies/reinforces need/impetus to begin/keep moving in the manner or direction described by the affix’s corresponding root without stopping. For static positional affixes, operates merely as a locative to specify an entity’s X/Y/Z position.</li><li><strong>Motion out of X</strong>.

Specifically, exterior perlative motion/movement outside of, over, next to, alongside, “above”/“under” an adjacent (quasi-)static surface/medium; for translative motion affixes, implies motion on a course described by the affix’s corresponding root along, over, parallel to, around, “above”/“under”, or tracking/following an adjacent (quasi-)static surface/medium</li></ol></details><p>For Degree 6, the various Modulative affixes as well as Phase can be used to describe repeated, ongoing movement/motion, e.g., back-and-forth, to-and-fro, side-to-side, up-and-down, in-and-out, out-and-back, etc.</p><p>Besides movement/motion Roots, roots denoting any spatial referent/area also have corresponding affix-forms utilizing this pattern, e.g., front side, rear area, top area/space, area below/underneath, etc.</p><h4 id="translative-motion-roots" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#translative-motion-roots"><span>Translative Motion Roots</span></a></h4><p>Roots involving translative motion are modeled after the following basic root:</p>',19),ee=e("abbr",null,"M01",-1),te=e("div",{class:"indent"},[e("dl",null,[e("dt",null,[e("abbr",null,"BSC")]),e("dd",null,"act of translative motion from one spacetime location to another;
