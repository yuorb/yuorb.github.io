A grave accent may similarly be used over the vowel <strong>u</strong> to remind the speaker/reader not to collapse the /u/-sound into /w/ in words like <strong>ehùá</strong>.</p><h3 id="Sec1_3_2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec1_3_2"><span>1.3.2 Written juncture affixes/adjuncts</span></a></h3><p>In regard to parsing adjuncts (see <a href="02#Sec2_7">Sec. 2.7, No. 5</a>) and the <strong>ç(ë)</strong>- sentence-juncture affix (see <a href="11#Sec11_8">Sec. 11.8</a>), these are normally never written in either the romanization scheme or the native New Ithkuil script, given that their occurrence is entirely dependent on the specific way any given individual utters a sentence or group of sentences on any particular occasion.

While gemination does not occur in English on true phonological grounds, it does occur on morpho-phonological grounds, as seen in the difference in pronunciation of the phrase <q>a <strong>n</strong>atural</q> versus <q>u<strong>nn</strong>atural</q>. There are many languages, however, where phonologically-based gemination is an intrinsic component of the phonology (e.g., Italian, Japanese, Finnish).</p><p>In New Ithkuil, most consonants can be geminated. All consonants except for <strong>w</strong>, <strong>y</strong>, and the glottal stop <strong>’</strong> are capable of gemination between two vowels. In addition, all consonants except for <strong>w</strong>, <strong>y</strong>, and the stop consonants (-<strong>’</strong>, <strong>p</strong>, <strong>b</strong>, <strong>t</strong>, <strong>d</strong>, <strong>k</strong>, <strong>g</strong>) can be geminated in both word-initial and word-final position.</p><h3 id="pronunciation-of-geminated-consonants" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pronunciation-of-geminated-consonants"><span>Pronunciation of Geminated Consonants</span></a></h3><p>Consonants which are continuants (i.e., able to be sounded for an indefinite duration), specifically <strong>ç</strong>, <strong>ḑ</strong>, <strong>f</strong>, <strong>h</strong>, <strong>l</strong>, <strong>ļ</strong>, <strong>m</strong>, <strong>n</strong>, <strong>ň</strong>, <strong>ř</strong>, <strong>s</strong>, <strong>š</strong>, <strong>ţ</strong>, <strong>v</strong>, <strong>x</strong>, <strong>z</strong>, and <strong>ž</strong>, are simply pronounced for twice as long in duration when geminated.

If intervocalic, they are pronounced by momentarily holding the initial stop (plosive) component of the affricate before releasing it into the fricative or sibilant portion, e.g., intervocalic <strong>čč</strong> is pronounced as <strong>ttš</strong>. When in word-initial or word-final position, geminated pronunciation is achieved by simply lengthening the sibilant continuant portion of the affricate (i.e., the second sound of each affricate). Thus, <strong>čč</strong> in word-initial or word-final position is pronounced as <strong>tšš</strong>.</p><h3 id="romanized-orthography-of-geminates" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#romanized-orthography-of-geminates"><span>Romanized Orthography of Geminates</span></a></h3><p>Consonants written as single characters are simply written double when geminated, e.g., <strong>bb</strong>, <strong>čč</strong>, <strong>dd</strong>, <strong>nn</strong>, <strong>šš</strong>.</p><h2 id="Sec1_5" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Sec1_5"><span>1.5 Phonotactics</span></a></h2><p>Phonotactics refer to the arbitrary rules as to what combinations of consonants and vowels are permissible in a syllable or word of a particular language. This concept is called <strong>phonotaxis</strong> and such rules are known as phonotactical rules. These rules, peculiar to each language, explain, for example, why <em>sprelch</em> could be a hypothetical word in English, while <em>znatk</em> could not be, even though <em>znatk</em> is as easily pronounced by a linguist as <em>sprelch</em>. Rules governing syllable structure, diphthong formation, and overall phonetic euphony are all part of phonotactics.

Examples of such languages are Vietnamese, the various Chinese and other Southeast Asian languages, most of the sub-Saharan African languages, and some Native American languages such as Navajo. While New Ithkuil is not a tone language per se, it does employ a “pitch accent” system as the means by which word boundaries may be parsed by a listener.
