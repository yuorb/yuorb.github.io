The result of this one-to-one correspondence is that dependency grammars are word (or morph) grammars. All that exist are the elements and the dependencies that connect the elements into a structure.</p></blockquote><h3 id="parts-of-speech" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#parts-of-speech"><span>Parts of speech</span></a></h3><p>In New Ithkuil, there are three parts of speech (abbr. PoS): Formative, Adjunct, and Referential.</p><p>This is based on the definition of morphological slots. If defined according to syntax, we can make some subdivisions.</p><h3 id="nominal-vs-verbal" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#nominal-vs-verbal"><span>Nominal vs Verbal</span></a></h3><p>The Unframed Verbal Formative (abbr. UnV) bears ultimate stress and serves as the parent node of the highest-level clause within the sentence.</p><p>A formative exhibiting penultimate stress is classified as a Nominal Formative (abbr. NoF), whereas one displaying antepenultimate stress is categorized as a Framed Verbal Formative (abbr. FrV).</p><p>Nominal and Framed Verbal Formatives frequently serve as arguments to a Verbal Formative within the same clause, facilitated by Case and Case-Scope mechanisms. However, they also have the capacity to stand alone as complete sentences, devoid of an UnV.</p><p>Referentials and Suppletive Adjuncts serve the same syntactic function as (Nominal) Formatives; Although, they can only convey <abbr>CCN</abbr> case-scope (or <abbr>CCP/CCV</abbr> when in any Appositive/Associative/Relational case). Should their Slot lack the capacity to convey the necessary morphological information, it is recommended to utilize alternative Formatives or to apply Affix(ual Adjunct)s to meet the requirements.</p><p>The Unframed Verbal Formative and the Framed Verbal Formative are both types of Verbal Formative that can be utilized in constructing a clause.</p><p>A Verbal Formative (VeF) governs <abbr>CCA/CCS</abbr>-marked Formatives within the same clause. In the absence of <abbr>CCA/CCS</abbr>-marked Formatives, it governs <abbr>CCN</abbr>-marked Formatives. If there are adjacent Formatives marked with <abbr>CCP/CCV</abbr>, VeF also governs them. Note that the Case-Scope of a FrV interacts with the outside, not with the inside of the frame.</p><p>A term <em>Declined PoS</em> (DeP) refers to a PoS embodying <code>Vc</code>, namely, Nominal, Framed Verbal Formative, Referential and Suppletive Adjunct. Note that an UnV with Case-Stacking Affix is not regarded as a DeP.</p>',16),f=o('<h3 id="case-scope" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#case-scope"><span>Case-Scope</span></a></h3><p>Case-Scope constitutes a syntactic category of a DeP.</p><ul><li>A <abbr>CCA</abbr>-marked DeP governs every <abbr>CCN</abbr>-marked DeP within the same clause.</li><li>A <abbr>CCS</abbr>-marked DeP governs every <abbr>CCQ</abbr>-marked DeP within the same clause.</li><li>A <abbr>CCP/CCV</abbr>-marked DeP modifies the adjacent formative.</li></ul><p>Zero Case-Scope represents a distinctive instance of Case-Scope, wherein its presence suggests solely <abbr>CCN/CCP/CCV</abbr>, contingent upon the Case with which a DeP is marked. Typically, if a DeP marked with zero Case-Scope is assigned any Appositive/Associative/Relational case, it assumes <abbr>CCP/CCV</abbr> Case-Scope; conversely, if not, it assumes <abbr>CCN</abbr> Case-Scope.</p><p>The interplay between Zero Case-Scope and Case-Stacking Affix(es) unfolds thus: The application of a Case-Stacking Affix facilitates the addition of another case onto a formative, allowing it to bear multiple Case markings. When one of these Cases is of the Appositive/Associative/Relational variety while the other is not, it denotes that the formative carries both <abbr>CCN</abbr> and <abbr>CCP/CCV</abbr> Case-Scopes. However, when a DeP is marked with non-Zero Case-Scope and Case-Stacking Affix(es), it retains only a singular Case-Scope.</p><p>Notably, No Case-Scope diverges from Zero Case-Scope. It denotes a specialized instance of UnV, indicating the absence of Case-Scope, thereby permitting an UnV to govern any formative designated with any Case-Scope (excluding <abbr>CCQ</abbr>, which necessitates a formative marked with <abbr>CCS</abbr>) within the same clause.</p><p>The following situations are worth noting</p><ul><li>A <abbr>CCP/CCV</abbr>-marked DeP outside a frame can potentially modify both the initial formative (FrV) and the terminal DeP (the end of frame) within the frame. In this case, it should be considered dependent on a DeP within the frame but syntactically exterior to it.</li><li>A <abbr>CCP/CCV</abbr> chain (aka P0) is a modifying group of multiple DeP’s marked with <abbr>CCP/CCV</abbr>.</li><li>A pairing of [CCP] [CCV] denotes an incongruous combination wherein two DeP’s mutually modify and govern each other.</li><li>FrV is not compatible with <abbr>CCP</abbr>, unless the frame itself concludes with the same FrV.

Register Initial Adjunct and Final Adjunct encapsulate the governed content. A Register clause frequently imparts semantic insights to an adjoining formative (verbal or nominal); however, it should not be assumed that these words hold scope over the Register clause. Given that a Register clause functions as a parenthetical and self-contained sentence, its removal does not disrupt the overall message conveyed by the original sentence. These clauses have the flexibility to be situated at any point within a sentence, and may even function as standalone sentences. A typical illustration of this is the <abbr>NRR</abbr> Register, which, being the default Register, is frequently disregarded; thus, it is prudent to presume that any sentence, including sentences enclosed by Non-<abbr>NNR</abbr>, is <abbr>NNR</abbr>-marked. It is advisable to consider every sentence as being governed by the <abbr>NNR</abbr> Register. As <abbr>NNR</abbr> is signified by the zero marker, a <abbr>NNR</abbr> clause is inherently autonomous, not subject to subordination by other Register clauses, yet capable of exerting influence over each one individually.</p><p>A Sentence-Initial Bias governs the entirety of the sentence, except for the <abbr>NRR</abbr> Register. Bias(es) can form a sentence, but should still be <abbr>NNR</abbr>-marked.</p><div class="indent"><dl class="gloss"><dt>∅</dt><dd>NRR</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>(Çë)rral.</dt><dd>([sentence:]​-)“cat”-OBS</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>∅</dt><dd>NRR_END</dd></dl><div class="glend">A simple sentence composed of single UnV</div><dl class="gloss"><dt>∅</dt><dd>NRR</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>(Çë)hi</dt><dd>([sentence:]​-)SPF</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>...</dt><dd>...</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>hiu.</dt><dd>SPF_END</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>∅</dt><dd>NRR_END</dd></dl><div class="glend">A sentence composed of single Register clause</div><dl class="gloss"><dt>∅</dt><dd>NRR</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>(Çë)lf</dt><dd>([sentence:]​-)ACC</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>lst.</dt><dd>ANP</dd></dl><dl class="gloss"><dt>∅</dt><dd>NRR_END</dd></dl><div class="glend">A sentence composed of Biases</div></div><p>Simple Sentence</p>',5),g=o('<h2 id="pos-coordinative-connective-affixes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pos-coordinative-connective-affixes"><span>PoS &amp; Coordinative/Connective Affixes</span></a></h2><p>The Coordinative and Connective Affixes, employed in the formation of a Coordination Structure, serve the purpose of linking formatives, phrases, frames, or clauses within sentences.
