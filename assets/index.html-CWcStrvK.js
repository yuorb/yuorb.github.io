Consequently, there may be instances of omissions and conflicting behaviors. Therefore, relying solely on the official website for information regarding New Ithkuil is not dependable. It is advisable to consult the development documentation for a more reliable reference.

Any identified typos have been rectified.</p><p>Furthermore, the website offers access to resources and practical tools to help you learn New Ithkuil.</p><p>Moreover, it includes a Chinese translation and aims to produce a Japanese translation.
