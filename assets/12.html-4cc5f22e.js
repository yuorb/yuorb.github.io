However, the native writing system for New Ithkuil is unique to the language and is neither an alphabet, nor syllabary, nor ideographic system of writing, but rather is morpho-phonemic , that is, the graphic characters employed to display the written language convey both phonological and morphological (i.e., grammatical) information, by which the reader constructs the intended words being conveyed based upon the reader’s knowledge of the grammar of the language.</p><p>This morpho-phonemic principle can be illustrated by the following simple and crude analogy using Roman characters: suppose the past tense written form of the verb “go” in English were “gø” (pronounced “went”), where the diagonal bar through the vowel-letter conveys a change from present to past tense. This would be an example of a morpho-phonemic script, where the characters convey whatever phonetic information cannot be predicted, but where predictable forms (e.g., an English speaker’s knowledge that the past-tense form of “go” is “went”) are conveyed by a symbol or graphic modification indicating the intended morphological change only (e.g., change the verb to past tense), without any graphic representation of the phonetics of the resulting word itself.</p><p>Consequently, the New Ithkuil writing system provides characters to convey the basic consonants needed to display the unpredictable parts of a word, whether it be a lexemic root, the <code>Cs</code> portion of a <code>VxCs</code> Affix, or a specific Referential category, but otherwise provides only diacritic-like augmentations, patterned mutations of phonetic characters, or specialized glyphs, each conveying morphological (i.e., grammatical) modifications by which the reader uses their knowledge of the grammar to phonetically instantiate the correct word.<br> Sequence of Written Characters for Formatives</p><table><thead><tr><th>Primary Character</th><th>Secondary*Character</th><th>Secondary*Character(s)</th><th>Secondary Character(s)*[rotated]</th><th>Tertiary Character</th><th>Quarternary``Character</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>• Relation• Concatenation Status• Stem• Specification• Function• Context• Version• <code>Ca</code> (Affiliation, Configuration, Plexity, Perspective, Extension, Essence)</td><td><code>Cr</code>Main Root</td><td><code>Cs</code>(Slot V)</td><td><code>Cs</code>(Slot VII)[character is laterally rotated 180 degrees]</td><td>• Valence• Phase• Effect• Aspect• Level</td><td><code>VcVk</code> plus Mood and/or Case-Scope</td></tr></tbody></table><p>For a Concatenated Pair of formatives, each formative is simply written separately, first the concatenated formative, then the parent formative. There is no distinction made between the two except that the subscript diacritic on the word-initial Primary Character of the concatenated formative shows the concatenation status (see below).<br> 12.1 Primary Characters</p><p>A Primary Character is word-initial and shows <code>Vr</code> Specification, Function, and Context, plus <code>Vv</code> Version and Stem, plus all <code>Ca</code> information of a formative. It also indicates the Relation/Concatenation status of the formative. The figures below display how to write a Primary Character.<br> Figure 1: Showing Specification, Context, Relation and Concatenation Status on a Primary Character:</p><p><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_12_script_files/image002.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"><br> Figure 2: Showing Perspective and Extension on a Primary Character</p><p><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_12_script_files/image004.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"><br> Figure 3: Showing Configuration, Affiliation, and Essence on a Primary Character</p><p><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_12_script_files/image006.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"><br> Figure 4: Showing Stem, Function, Version, and Plexity on a Primary Character:</p><p><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_12_script_files/image008.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"><br> Figure 5: Example of a Primary Character</p><p><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_12_script_files/image010.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"><br> 12.2 Secondary Characters</p><p>Secondary Characters immediately follow the Primary Character and are used for showing consonantal information for the Slot III <code>Vr</code> affix as well as the consonantal <code>Cs</code> information for any Slot V and Slot VII <code>VxCs</code> affixes. The 28 forms below are the “core” characters, whose “top” and “bottom” ends then take extensions in order to prefix or suffix additional consonants shown in Sec. 12.2.1 below.

Applying these extensions to the upper end of a core consonant character adds a preceding consonant to that shown by the core character. Extensions applied to the lower end add a following consonant. Additional consonants may be added by applying these extensions to a “placeholder” character which, if used, immediately follows the consonantal character.</p><figure><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_12_script_files/image015.jpg" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_12_script_files/image017.jpg" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_12_script_files/image019.jpg" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_12_script_files/image021.jpg" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3 id="_12-2-2-using-secondary-characters-to-show-vxcs-affixes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_12-2-2-using-secondary-characters-to-show-vxcs-affixes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 12.2.2 Using Secondary Characters to Show <code>VxCs</code> Affixes</h3><p>Use the Secondary Characters with their extensions for any Slot V <code>Cs</code> character(s), placed immediately following the <code>Cr</code> character. Use the following underposed diacritics to show Degree:</p><p><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_12_script_files/image023.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"><br> To show Type-2 or Type-3 <code>VxCs</code> affixes: For Type-2 <code>VxCs</code> affixes add a super-posed dot diacritic above the character; for Type-3 affixes, use a super-posed bar diacritic.<br> To show Slot VII <code>VxCs</code> affixes: Place any Slot VII <code>Cs</code>character(s) immediately after any Slot V <code>Cs</code>character(s) but rotate the character 180 degrees (i.e, they are upside-down but not horizontal mirror-images). Type-2 and Type-3 Slot VII affixes are marked using the same superposed dot or bar diacritics as above.</p><p>he rotated consonant characters used for Slot VII <code>VxCs</code> affixes are shown in Sec. 12.2.3 below.<br> Note on showing Affixual Scoping: While the spoken language allows for the use of Affixual Adjuncts to indicate scoping in addition to (or as a substitute for) the ordering of affixes in Slots V and VII of a formative, the written language makes do only with the sequential ordering of the Secondary <code>Cs</code>character(s) within a formative (i.e., it is up to the reader as to whether to interpret the affixes as being spoken as an affixual adjunct rather than within the formative). Nevertheless, there is one diacritic mark used with Secondary <code>Cs</code>character(s) – a dot placed along the right side of a Secondary <code>Cs</code>character, to show that the affix has scope over the entire formative as a whole, including Valence, Mood or Case, Illocution &amp; Validation, etc.<br> 12.2.3 Rotated Secondary Characters</p><p>Rotated Secondary Characters are identical to standard Secondary characters except they are laterally rotated 180 degrees. They are used to show any Slot VII <code>VxCs</code> affix(es) and are placed immediately following any Slot V <code>VxCs</code> affix(es), or immediately after the first (non-rotated) Consonant Character if there is no Slot V <code>VxCs</code> affix. Any Type-2 <code>VxCs</code> affix is shown by a super-posed dot diacritic, while a Type-3 <code>VxCs</code> affix is shown by a superposed horizontal bar diacritic. Rotated Secondary Characters are also used to show Specialized <code>Cs</code> roots and Specialized Personal-Reference roots, as explained in Sec. 12.2.4 below.</p><p><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_12_script_files/image025.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"><br> 12.2.4 Showing Specialized <code>Cs</code> -Roots and Specialized Personal-Reference Roots</p><p>Rotated Secondary Characters are also used to show a Specialized <code>Cs</code> -Root where the Slot III <code>Cr</code> infix is replaced by a the <code>Cs</code> consonantal form of a <code>VxCs</code> affix (see Sec. 10.3 ), as well as a Specialized Personal-Reference Root where the Slot III <code>Cr</code> infix is replaced by a single or combination Referential affix (see Sec. 10.4 ).</p><p>To show a Specialized <code>Cs</code> -Root, use a rotated Secondary Characters shown shown above in place of the initial (non-rotated) Secondary Character representing <code>Cr</code> . It is the use of a rotated Secondary Character immediately following the word-initial Primary Character that indicates to the reader that the word is a Specialized <code>Cs</code> -Root.</p><p>A Specialized Personal-Reference Root is indicated using a rotated Secondary Character in place of the initial (non-rotated) Secondary Character representing <code>Cr</code> , exactly the same as a Specialized <code>Cs</code> -Root immediately above, except that the rotated Secondary Character carries a super-posed dot diacritic.<br> 12.3 Tertiary Characters</p><p>A Tertiary Character is a composite character placed after all Secondary Characters. It indicates Valence, Aspect, Phase, Effect, &amp; Level.</p><p><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_12_script_files/image027.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"><br> 12.4 Quarternary Characters</p><p>A Quarternary Character is placed immediately after any Tertiary Character. It is used for displaying <code>Vc</code> Case and <code>Vk</code> Illocution+Validation, as well as <code>Cm</code> Mood and <code>Cc</code> Case-Scope. <code>Vc</code> and <code>Vk</code> are shown by extensions to the top and bottom ends of a plain vertical bar. Mood and Case-Scope are indicated by diacritics shown in Sec. 12.4.1 below.</p><p><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_12_script_files/image028.gif" alt="Text Box: VER" loading="lazy"><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_12_script_files/image030.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"><br> 12.4.1 Diacritics Used with Quarternary Characters</p><p>Diacritic marks are used on Quarternary Characters to show Case-Scope, Mood, as well as Case-Accessor Affixes and Case-Stacking affixes.<br> Mood: Shown via a superposed diacritic above a Quaternary Character, as shown below.</p><p><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_12_script_files/image032.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"><br> Case-Scope: Shown via an underposed diacritic below a Quarternary Character, as shown above<br> Case-Accessor Affixes: These are composed of a Quaternary Character indicating Case, accompanied by special diacritics.</p><p><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_12_script_files/image033.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"><br> Type-2 or Type-3 Case-Accessor affixes: For Type-2 add a super-posed dot diacritic above the Quaternary character; for Type-3, use a super-posed bar diacritic above the Quaternary character.<br> Distinguishing Case-Accessor Affixes in Slot V vs. Slot VII: If necessary to distinguish a Slot VII case-accessor affix from one in Slot V, the one in Slot VII adds a dot to the diacritic as follows:</p><p><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_12_script_files/image034.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"><br> Case-Stacking: A second case, with scope over the first, is shown by simply adding a 2<sup>nd</sup> Quaternary Character immediately after the first.<br> 12.4.2 Alternative To Using Quaternary Characters – Showing <code>Vc</code> /<code>Vk</code> Using Diacritics on the <code>Cr</code> Character</p><p>If Mood and Case-scope are default FAC /CCN (so that there are no diacritics above or below the Quaternary <code>Vc</code> /<code>Vk</code> Character), then the option exists to dispense with the Quaternary character and instead show <code>Vc</code> or <code>Vk</code> on the <code>Cr</code> consonantal root character using the superposed and underposed diacritics shown below:<br> Showing <code>Vc</code> Case:</p><p><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_12_script_files/image036.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"><br> Showing <code>Vk</code> Illocution/Validation:</p><p><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_12_script_files/image037.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"><br> 12.4.3 Showing Referentials</p><p>To show a referential, use a Quaternary Character followed by a Secondary Character (with extensions if needed) to indicate the specific personal referent(s) with a superposed horizontal bar diacritic on the Secondary Character. Dual-referent adjuncts are written as two referentials next to each other. To show case-stacking on a Referential, place the second Quarternary Character AFTER the Secondary Character (i.e., so that the Secondary Character is sandwiched between the two Quarternary Characters.<br> 12.5 Bias Characters</p><p>Bias Characters are used to show a Bias Adjunct. If sentence-initial, place immediately the Bias Character before the first formative or referential without a space between them. Likewise, if sentence-final, place the Bias Character immediately after the last formative or referential without a space between them. If used as a standalone sentence of its own, separate it from the preceding and/or following sentences by a space.</p><figure><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_12_script_files/image039.jpg" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><ul><li>DCC and PSM Biases are distinguished from the ACC and FSC biases by use of a dot diacritic as shown below:</li></ul><p><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_12_script_files/image041.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"><br> 12.6 Showing Register</p><p>The following symbols are placed before and after a phrase to mark various registers. Each register has four modes; the first indicates register only while the second mode indicates a proper name or foreign word/phrase written alphabetically. For the third and fourth modes (Transcriptive and Transliterative), see next page.</p><figure><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_12_script_files/image043.jpg" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><ul><li>seeSec. 12.6.1 below<br> 12.6.1 Transcriptive &amp; Transliterative Modes: The Phonetic Representation (or Suppression) of Adjuncts</li></ul><p>Being a morpho-phonemic writing system, the script does not normally represent adjuncts. Consequently, a written passage may have different spoken interpretations by a reader, i.e., it is up to the reader whether to utilize adjuncts or not when reading aloud a written passage in the language.</p><p>Nevertheless, in certain circumstances such as when reading poetry or song lyrics, reading the script of a play, or a word-for-word transcription, it becomes desirable to indicate to the reader exactly how a written passage is to be read aloud. This is the purpose of the Transcriptive and Transliterative modes.<br> Transcriptive* Mode indicates that the word/phrase inside the markers is to be read exactly as standardly written, i.e., without using adjuncts (other than carrier adjuncts). It is also used to indicate the functions of both a Quotative Adjunct (see Sec. 4.5.2 of the Design Document) and a Phrasal Adjunct (see Sec. 4.5.4 of the Design Document).<br> Transliterative* Mode indicates the word/phrase within the markers is one of the following: (1) a phonemic rendering of an adjunct written using Secondary Characters written alphabetically, or (2) a Tertiary Character representing a Modular Adjunct, to be read Valence first, then the top “half”, then the bottom “half”. It is also used to indicate the function of a Naming Adjunct (see Sec. 4.5.3 of the Design Document).<br> 12.7 Alphabetic Writing</p><p><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_12_script_files/image045.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy">Use Secondary Characters and their extensions plus the placeholder character for alphabetic writing of proper names and foreign words, preceded and followed by the appropriate double-dot diacritic (shown later in the Section on writing Register Adjuncts).</p><p>Additionally, use the diacritics shown below for vowels, placed above the character for a preceding vowel, under the character for a following vowel. Use the placeholder character (shown at left) for standalone vowels if necessary. Show 2-vowel conjuncts (including diphthongs) by superposing the first vowel diacritic on the placeholder character and underposing the second vowel diacritic. To show a single vowel between two single consonants, use the placeholder character with the two consonant extensions at top and bottom, with the vowel diacritic placed along the right side of the character.</p><figure><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_12_script_files/image046.jpg" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Option to show 2-vowel conjuncts/diphthongs without using a placeholder character : To show a two-vowel conjunct or diphthong <em>preceding</em> a full-consonant conjunct, place the first vowel diacritic above the Secondary character and the second vowel diacritic along the right side. To show a following 2-vowel conjunct or diphthong, place the first vowel diacritic along the right side and the second vowel diacritic below the character.</p><p><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_12_script_files/image047.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy">Indicating Stress in Alphabetic Writing: Penultimate stress is unmarked; otherwise, the stressed vowel should be shown on a stand-alone plain vertical bar shown here instead of the usual placeholder character.</p><p><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_12_script_files/image049.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy">Additional Characters for Alphabetic Writing: The character-shape shown at below is utilized in multiple ways as a means of representing foreign words/sounds when writing alphabetically:</p><p><img src="http://ithkuil.net/newithkuil_12_script_files/image050.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"><br> 12.7.1 Showing Carrier Adjuncts/Stems</p><p>Use the appropriate register markers above in Alphabetic mode, and insert a Quaternary Case character between the initial register marker and the first Secondary alphabetic character.
