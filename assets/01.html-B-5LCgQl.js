If intervocalic, they are pronounced by momentarily holding the initial stop (plosive) component of the affricate before releasing it into the fricative or sibilant portion, e.g., intervocalic <strong>čč</strong> is pronounced as <strong>ttš</strong>. When in word-initial or word-final position, geminated pronunciation is achieved by simply lengthening the sibilant continuant portion of the affricate (i.e., the second sound of each affricate).

These rules, peculiar to each language, explain, for example, why <em>sprelch</em> could be a hypothetical word in English, while <em>znatk</em> could not be, even though <em>znatk</em> is as easily pronounced by a linguist as <em>sprelch</em>.
